When we got the time to plan and consider carefully all the details to mitigate anticipated problems and issues. When time was still in our hands to plan early to minimise as much as possible the impact. Now i will tell the story of my experience on a BCP development.   When i was still in the big public transport corp before i left in 2008, due to my involvement and even secondment to develop in the now widely used transport card. BCP was also a part of the work i had to look into and facilitate the contractor in this development. We had this session to interview some key stakeholders and were asking lots of questions to get answers. One of those question was abt the intrusion of the depot. The response was, \u201cNo, this will not happen.\u201d Even when the contractor attempted to ask in different ways to get further advancement on this issue, the answer was like \u201cNo, 100% that the depot will never ever be intruded.\u201d Yes, we missed that opportunity to prevent, and to react on depot intrusion even when measures were put in place. Yrs later, actually after i left when i saw that piece of news. I learned.   Ultimately when developing BCP, it depends a lot from the feedback and response from key stakeholders. Therefore when stakeholders are in the mode within their own \u201cexpertise\u201d, sometimes it\u2019s not easy to break out of it and understand what could be done to prevent problems from happening in their area of expertise. The key is to be opened and explore all possible and conceivable scenarios. And then preparations can be done to mitigate the impact and reduce the damage crisis will do. And hence, when i mentioned in early stage, the longer we drag, the longer the outbreak will drag on us and hence, the impact and the damage. Everything needs preparation, and it had to be done.....early.

I think it\u2019s about time we rethink our strategy. Up till today, there is little transparency on how many cases did we test in a day? Other countries have developed high-capacity diagnostic machines that can test tens of thousands of cases a single day. Do we have such diagnostic machines or are we doing this manually? If we don\u2019t have such technology for fast testing, perhaps we could reach out to those countries to learn? Let\u2019s stop praising ourselves at the contact tracing and start testing aggressively.

Other countries have spike of cases not because they are lousy, it\u2019s because they are out there testing. I don\u2019t believe the cases presented here are actual representation of cases on the ground, esp local cases where testing was somewhat discouraged by NCID. Perhaps NCID disclose the max number of cases you could test in a day? So that private enterprises and individuals can step in to help. How many cases can we test in a day? Is there a bottleneck? Do we have the technology? Let\u2019s all be more transparent when the no of cases tested daily and what can we do to a accelerate the testing.

Part of the answer to that is that even in reported cases, which represent a fraction of actual total cases, rather than an absolute total as to infections, more people may be suffering lack of adequate care as would be needed to facilitate recovery. That could be the case that fewer serious cases are being admitted as such, globally, due to constraints on resources, and fear of institutional spread of the illness.   We believe that the 5.5% figure is well below the realities of any more objective, and inclusive, medical standard of measure.  It may in fact be excessively subjective, based on little more than a more restrictive triage criteria that has become more exclusionary. The number of persons who get infected, expected to require significant medical care, remains near to 20% and this is supported by a recent estimation that is based on the statistics reported by New York State, United States of America. That is consistent with early estimations based on medical case studies and other fact based information. That indicates a higher risk level, for victims of the disease, in some countries, where medical care is becoming less available, for a variety of reasons.   We currently believe that China does have more cases than it is confirming and reporting, and that they are being discouraged from institutional treatment. There is a need to weigh the statistical numbers of COVID-19 cases against other urgent and chronic needs, due to other illnesses, and other pathogens. COVID-19 is far from the only challenge that global healthcare is confronted with. There are many and some show worsening trends, for various reasons. China for instance is now believed to be suffering from outbreaks of a variant of \"Bird Flu\". Another serious illness that can require hospitalization treatment. We are uncertain at this point in time as to how the combination of \"mild to serious\" COVID-19 infections will affect long term health of infected individuals. There are indications that there will be a significant percentage of the infected, who recover, who will show long term complications. Particularly respiratory damage but not limited to respiratory complications. There may be a wide range of illness, requiring medical treatment, springing from the COVID-19 pandemic. I would tend to predict that there will be based on what we know thus far.   China's pervasive disregard for the individual and devaluing of the individual, in contrast to the value placed on depersonalized mass statistics, represents a very real danger as to China's apparent choice of strategies, and its growing censorship of dissent, the media and the press. That could lead China to a policy of disregard within the confines of worst case epidemiological predications. A condition that would be unthinkable in the individual valuing Western, non Communist, world. Whether that represents a more accurate picture of the politically skewed data remains subject to confirmatory intelligence. Something that China has proven itself remarkably resistant to permitting. That in itself creates very significant doubts about its honesty in reporting.   What is most important to note is the mass perception that the numeric statistical reporting is in some way a more absolute measure than it really is. It is in fact only an indicator, and in some cases is believed to be well below actual levels of community infection.

From their skin cells or hair follicles cells where DNA is encapsulated within it. On the other hand, virus protein coat is the only thing that encapsulate it's genetic materials. Once the protein is broken, the genetic materials will leak out.  b) Which brings me to the point that DNA and RNA are very different. DNA is double-stranded which makes it extremely stable outside of its encapsulated environment. While RNA is single-stranded and is a lot more unstable compared to DNA. Coronavirus is a RNA virus. I wonder what kind of assay the team has used to test for presence of the viral genetic materials.  c) In our our living environment, there are tons of DNAase and RNAase presence on our saliva and hands. These -ase would have degraded the exposed DNA and RNA material in the environment, which will make detection very difficult.  d) The interpretation of the result has to take into context of the test environment to better interpret its results.","Regardless, it is important for us to clean the surface regularly to ensure we don't live in a contaminated environment.

Its day 4 for me and I'm stuck in my own room.   But from my experience, when I landed in Singapore, the officers at the immigration was so unclear of the procedures, not sure it is because it is midnight or there is a change in shift. When passing through, they are suppose to give a sticker and paste it on us but for one of my friend, they sticked it on the stay home notice paper, which made me question if they actually know what they are suppose to do.   Then, there was another round of checking by another 2 officers where they checked our answers to the questions (last page) and tore out the paper for them to keep. Everything look professionally handled until I was about to leave and scan my passport. The officers held me back and asked me for my flight number, which my other 3 friends did not write. There were 2 officers, one forgotten, its okay but I was the last of the 4 and they only remembered it when it was my turn\u2026 I was like \u201cso now I need to write my flight number which is not indicated in the form?\u201d And I needed to write it for my other friend as well cause he passed the gantry.   Then, after passing everything and getting my luggage, I wasn\u2019t sure if my 14 days starts on the day I landed, cause there wasn\u2019t a clear indication on the form that I signed for when I am ending the Stay Home Notice. Thus, I went to the counter outside the arrival gates and asked one of the staff there for more details. To my surprise, the staff wasn\u2019t sure and they said something along the lines of like I should be asking the officers inside cause this matter is under them. However the staff was nice and helped me to contact someone to help me clarify my doubt. She then replied that the day I land is Day 0 and that my stay home notice starts the day after. I was surprised by the answer cause I think that it doesn\u2019t make sense to me. I even commented saying \u201cso I am allowed to go out on day 0 and then start serving on Day 1?\u201d The staff agreed to me but then again, she wasn\u2019t sure so can't really blame her so I went straight home and stayed in my room ever since.

Our PM, President and MP out at Food courts, attending exhibition....how is the public not confused and hence the elderlies in karaoke sessions for CNY dinners.  Proper cross borders agreement to send Travelers with detected fever at checkpoints back just announced today. Short term visitors and some transit workers are still sent to hotels for 14 days quarantine. How is that a proper containment measure given hotel staff are not properly trained and possibly wearing useless and cheaper surgical masks? Proper measures should have been in place from the onset.  I get the point the situation is more dire and quickly escalating. Weddings and all church services - not just 10 pax - should be banned. But total lockdown and movement control when Fairprice website already keep crashing even before this pandemic starts? (I know becos I have advanced cancer and regularly order online for groceries for years)  We absolutely need a full review given now reported 200,000 Singaporean are returning from abroad.

The only thing we are permitted to do now \u2014 besides eat and breathe \u2014 is to go to work or school. It's a miserable existence, isn't it?  Right now, with one industry closing after another in dribs and drabs, we will be losing our jobs left, right, and centre. But if everyone froze together, we should in theory be able to keep all our jobs. Leave the essential services open, like clinics, supermarkets, and delivery, and that should mitigate panic-buying.

I don't know how much we have in our national reserves \u2014 that is off-limits to public knowledge. But our government has always said that we have been saving for a rainy day. Today is that rainy day. No recession or crisis in our 55-year national history has ever grounded our religious, recreational, and social activities to a halt. A lockdown is going to be an expensive endeavour, especially if we are to support the financially vulnerable among us. But today is the rainy day we have been saving up for.  Enough with the \"new normal\" \u2014 it's a dystopia. Let's just pay the price and get back our real normal, maybe with some precautions still in place.

But it becomes a Russian roulette as the virus is still active in the community (since there is a no. of unlinked cases) and the risk is that one could infect one's family members unknowingly esp the seniors when one catches the virus from the community.   So nobody knows the extent of the infection and it could suddenly explode since covid19 is very infectious. Probably it will be good if we can have an understanding when the \"flattening the curve\" is not working, perhaps daily confirmed cases over 100? When that happens, probably lockdown would be good as we isolate ourselves and thus force the people with the virus to be out in the open and end all chains of transmission. ","So the writer\u2019s conclusion is: Economy > Lives. When all on death bed, who runs the economy? People who fails to see the bigger picture usually fails to have a future.

Lock down is a drastic short cut to supposedly control the outbreak, which, I don't think is currently out of control. As it is, without lock down, many businesses big and small are suffering. It would be that much harder for our economy to revive later on if we decide on that path now.

These children may not be isolated at home. They may interact with people from the outside of their usual community. There would then be a higher risk of them contracting covid or spread if they already have it.  The schools however must be extra vigilant. Keep a close eye on children who have signs of infection, no matter how mild it may be. Isolate them and send home immediately. If possible, call every household to double check if they have family members who recently travelled to high risk areas like UK or USA who were not imposed with the SHN that requires them to be quarantined separately in a gov facility. Keep these children at home too.

No doubt about it  Everyone should practise good hygiene and take this time to inculcate good habits in their younger ones. Little ones must learn that they must wash they hands often.

Wash hands before mealtimes, use serving cutlery instead of dipping their individual cutlery into the dishes. They can also try to eat separately. Do portioning of food.   Do not jump into the bed when then reach home. If they do, let them wash the sheets themselves.    Clean door handles and frequently touched areas periodically.    Wear mask when not feeling well. If you are not well, you should be home, not roaming around just because you think you are sick already and cannot get any worse.

I do not find the reason for suspending tuition logical. ","Do not worry soon or later all the schools will close for 14 days..","These parents - tuition got aircon, schools on natural ventilation. Just for now, wake up can?","Don't always complaint . Never ever decision  made can please everybody.  Decision are made  for general  public health safety.","","Agreed that it\u2019s self contradiction to make such decision. ","We have reached that stage where keeping children at home becomes the most assuring option. However, there are several considerations to take note if we truly care about our children's and family well being.  Ensure safety of children at home by appointing appropriate caregivers.  Regardless the condition where children are on mandatory LOA or optional home LOA, their safety should always be priority especially for children in lower primary and pre schools. Cooped up at home, children may feel restless and over the days irritable. This is especially when it is not the school holidays, their friends may still be attending school and both parents may still have to work. In this situation, appointing an appropriate caregiver is most important.  The caregiver should be able to monitor the children in their diet, hygiene, home based learning, home based recreation and most important of all ensure children stay home. Caregivers should also be firm enough to separate the children from whoever that is entering the home from work or market be it elder siblings from school, parents from work or helper from the shops, until those returning home have exercised thorough hand washing and preferably, change of clothes. This is an important consideration as the intent of keeping children home from school is to reduce the risk of SARS-Cov-2 virus (i. e. virus responsible for the Severe Acute Respiratory Illness Covid-19) transmission to the children.  Who is an appropriate caregiver?  This is of course for the parents to decide. However, as far as possible, best to avoid having grandparents as caregivers.  Why not?  Firstly, grandparents may be a little less cooperative following instructions from you, their own children\/children in law (their grandchildren's parents). There is also a tendency where grandparents can be a little over permissive. In the situation where attentive restrictions are required, grandparents may be most challenged to keep children at home.  While that is a lesser concern, the more important concern is that grandparents, especially those over 60, are more susceptible to severe complications if infected should the SARS-COv-2 virus (i. e. virus responsible for the Severe Acute Respiratory Illness Covid-19) be silently residing in children without showing any symptoms. Grandparents love the hugs and kisses from grandchildren but these hugs and kisses may be deadly for them. This is especially for children on mandatory LOA.  While staying home and away from school is probably the best option to safeguard children from the transmission chain, when both parents are working (especially those in essential services) caregiving arrangement will be a challenge. In this situation, perhaps, keeping children in school is the better option until a suitable and cooperative caregiver can stand in for parents.  With the scenario of full closures of schools become a vivid plausible reality, now is the best time to work out caregiving arrangements. For some of us, adults, who are able to stay home friendly neighbours, relatives and friends to parents who may be required to work, perhaps, caregiving support may be offered.","Tuition  centre is students from different school.

All of China state's overseas assets including its forex reserves of $3.1 trillion will have to be confiscated to compensate the world for all losses - estimated at about $2.5 trillion.  Under the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR), a World Health Organization (WHO) treaty, China - a member state - has duty to prevent domestic public health emergencies from becoming international problems.  The law requires China to notify the WHO of events that may constitute any illness that \"presents or could present significant harm to humans\" or \"public health emergency of international concern\".  Under Article 6 of the IHR treaty, China has the duty to inform the WHO about the viral outbreak within 24 hours of determining its nature. Article 7 also requires China, after notification, to continue to provide \"timely, accurate and sufficiently detailed and available public health information\".  There is an abundance of evidence that suggest as early as December 2019, XJP\/CCP had known that Covid-19 (China Originated Virus Infectious Disease 2019) was dangerous and capable of causing a pandemic, but they did cover up the coronavirus outbreak for 6 weeks. Only on 21\/01\/2020 did XJP\/CCP finally inform the WHO the true nature of the outbreak.  Therefore member states can sue China before international tribunals for breach of duty and violating its obligation to report the coronavirus outbreak under the IHR.  Whenever a state commits internationally unlawful conduct, it must pay reparations to the injured parties for the damage they suffered. Thus, China is liable to pay reparations over its failure to promptly notify the WHO about the outbreak."],"141":["Caused by corona virus.","Water is money","Back  charge t  main  contractor for  all  t  water  wasted  ","Most easy get virus place are toilet , affected person urine evaporate in the air, contain on the toilet bowl.

Other countries which started having coronavirus cases later than us have thousands or tens of thousands of cases and many more deaths. Our government has taken careful and calibrated measures to keep those numbers down. I don't know why Singaporeans love lockdowns. In Malaysia, the government implemented the lockdown because thousands of people who attended a particular prayer cannot be located because a few of them tested positive for coronavirus. That is an evidence of a potential significant community spreading event. In Singapore, there is no evidence of a significant spreading event and our contact tracing is done so efficiently and speedily unlike many countries in eliminating numerous clusters as and when they arise. Even in South Korea, where there was a super spreading event caused by the Shincheonji church members, they did not impose a lockdown. They relied heavily on contact tracing and mass testing to arrest the coronavirus infection figures and it worked. They didn't impose a lockdown. Lockdowns are usually for large, poor or countries experiencing high rates of untraceable coronavirus cases as it is the most extreme measure.","Never trust WHO!","You just need 1 irresponsible parents that came back from overseas before yesterday SHN was implemented to spread .

If one day, if a local needs it then if capacity unfortunately then hit the limit,  what are hospitals supposed to do, plug out the lift support from non-locals and give to locals and let the non-local die?  It will be inhumane and legally wrong. The locals will have to wait it out but what if he couldn't wait.   The next step of defence to stop this scenario is to curb local transmission, if any, hopefully gov will help stop all unnecessary events, activities that would attract crowd regardless of the numbers. Eg:  promotions at tourist attractions areas, etc.   Because if an activity is at an open space how do we define the numbers, or the host can argue on the loop hole that the crowd come themselves, or people are passing by. But in fact without these promotions, the crowd won't go there.

So Japan and Taiwan were correct. Many of the US deaths attributed to the flu were actually from the coronavirus.  One Senator asked Redfield if post-mortems were performed to learn the cause of death, and he stated that such were done, and they revealed mis-diagnoses.  The infections and deaths have been knowingly mis-categorised for months, and the CDC \u2018strongly\u2019 recommended that hospitals not test for the virus except as a last resort. It is not an accident that the US has no reliable tests. They don\u2019t want to test. Blame everything on the flu.

As a country, we need to revisit the controversial idea of wearing a surgical mask whenever we are in public places - the least we can do other than all the other measures like personal hygiene, social distancing, crowd restrictions, stay at home, no visitors, etc...   I could understand why we shouldn\u2019t be wearing a mask in the initial stages of this outbreak when the global demand for masks was extremely high and the main supply was terminated with China locked down. Today, the global supply of masks is coming back with China alone making some 200M surgical masks a day.   Note that we are rather unique by not shutting down schools and workplaces and people are still free to move around, we should therefore wear a mask to give another layer of protection. With a mask on, it would also help to make it difficult to touch the nose and mouth.   One MAJOR contributor to China\u2019s quick success to wrest back control is to strictly enforce the wearing of a surgical mask.   Please reconsider this as the supply situation now offers us an opportunity to reduce our exposure to this dangerous virus.

We appreciate the help from our foreign workforce.  The accumulation of the national reserves started with the founding of Singapore in 1965.  Before independence, the people in Singapore paid taxes to the British Empire, Japanese Empire and later Federation of Malaya. There may be later some transfer of these funds that also made up the initial Singapore National Reserves from the British Empire and Federal government of Malaya (not much records on this).   The composition of the workforce was almost entirely Singaporeans when Singapore became independent in 1965.  The composition of the workforce started changing in late 1980s with the arrival of the Malaysian workers in Singapore.  More foreign workers arrived in Singapore by 1990s.  Hence, we are grateful for the foreign workforce's contribution however from 1965 to around 1980s, the workforce was mainly made up of Singaporeans.  What is common throughout the entire history of Singapore is that Singaporeans made up a big part of the work force.   Being a Singaporean, comes with its obligations for the men in the form of National Service.  To add on, the criteria for the assistance for the self employed Singaporean are too strict hence some Singaporeans who need help are not getting it.  This saddened some of the Singaporeans.  Some of the Singaporeans who need help are not getting enough help under this supplementary budget.  To the foreigners who want to receive the assistance from the supplementary budget, the solution is very simple. Put in your application to be a Singaporean if you meet the terms and conditions.  Good luck in your citizenship application process.
