His family had stocked the fridge with groceries and daily essentials for the 25-year-old University of Cambridge history student to serve out his 14-day stay-home notice at the four-room Housing Board unit in Punggol.  +I+m isolating myself and treating it as if I have the virus. I don+t want to put my family at risk because within the UK, we don+t know who has the virus and who doesn+t,+ Mr Lim told The Straits Times over the phone, acknowledging it was +lucky+ a relative was willing to let him stay in the flat.  His parents, who are in their 60s, occasionally drop off food at his front door. Mr Lim, who said he is feeling well, only opens the door and waves to them when they are at the lift landing some metres away.  Mr Lim is one of many Singaporeans studying overseas who have returned home in the past week, following an advisory issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on Tuesday to do so, as the number of Covid-19 cases around the world increase rapidly.  Since Saturday, Singaporeans and residents returning to the country have to serve a mandatory 14-day stay-home notice. All short-term visitors will no longer be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore from 11.59pm on Monday.  +The moment the MFA issued the advisory, everyone around me who had lingering doubts about whether or not to go back made their decision. I think it was quite a relief for many of us because every extra day you+re there adds to the tension,+ said Mr Lim.  What ensued was a +mad rush+ to book a one-way flight ticket, pack four years+ worth of belongings into two bags and settle a number of administrative tasks, he added. He does not expect to return to the UK as he is in his final year.  Mr Lim now monitors his temperature twice daily and records it on a whiteboard which has a countdown to the day he can step out of the house.  Some returning overseas students said it was a relief to return to Singapore.  At the beginning of the week, fine arts undergraduate student Joshua Lau, 22, said he and his sister Deborah Lau, 23, were still debating whether to leave London, as flight prices were fluctuating every hour.  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore residents who travel overseas may face consequences as Govt ramps up border controls  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  +But when we stepped into Changi, it was a huge mental relief. Our fear was if we had gotten sick in London, we wouldn+t be able to get proper healthcare because we+re international students,+ said Mr Lau, who attends Central Saint Martins in London. His sister is an arts and culture management postgraduate student at King+s College.  He added that he knows of at least 15 other Singaporean students who have flown back home this week.  The flight home was not without drama for Mr Lau, who said some travellers at Gatwick Airport where he was taking his flight had on hazmat suits and raincoats.  He and his sister only wore masks on the flight, as that was all they had.  Back in Singapore, they disinfected their luggage and shoes before stepping into the house and now spend most of their time in separate bedrooms.  +If I want to talk to my family in person, we+ll stand a distance away. Hugs can wait; what+s important is that we+re all back together safely,+ said Mr Lau.  National University of Singapore medical school student Shanisse Tsai, 22, shares the same sentiment.  Ms Tsai, who was in Boston for a four-week internship programme at Harvard Medical School, decided to self-isolate for two weeks despite having arrived a day before the stay-home notice kicked in.  +I went through the airports and various points of contacts, so even though it+s not mandatory for me to stay home, I think the socially responsible thing to do is to isolate myself,+ she said.  She is working on a research project in place of the now-cancelled internship programme, which she had only completed two of the scheduled four weeks. Her family members leave her meals outside her door.  Ms Tsai had initially planned for a two-week vacation after her internship and had bought tickets to the now-postponed music festival Coachella in California as her +last hurrah+ before her final year.  +At first it was quite disappointing to leave because the internship position was really hard to get. But as the situation got more serious in Boston, nothing beats the anticipation to get home; I just wanted to come home as soon as possible,+ she said.  Ms Tsai has started sharing her stay-home experience on social media in addition to keeping touch with her friends over video calls.  She said: +I+m vlogging my life in this small space so after 14 days, I can look back to see what I did and help other people think of things to do in their rooms.+","1":"SINGAPORE - Education Minister Ong Ye Kung responded to parents+ concerns about schools reopening on Monday (March 23), citing scientific evidence, extra precautions, and a desire to reduce disruptions as key considerations in allowing students to resume classes.  His Facebook post on Sunday came after Singapore announced it would bar all short-term visitors from entering or transiting through the country from 11.59pm on Monday, to reduce the risk of imported coronavirus cases.  Said Mr Ong: +Part of the reason for the tougher border measures is to ensure we keep Singapore as safe as possible, so that daily activities, like going to work, eating out and attending school, can go on.+  He noted that he has received many e-mails and messages from parents, with some asking why the March holidays were not extended, especially given the rising numbers of imported Covid-19 cases and impending border closures.  Others, including several students, urged the Ministry of Education (MOE) to keep schools open, as they would like to go to school, he added.  Setting out MOE+s thinking on the matter, he said Covid-19 does not affect the young as much as it does adults - echoing remarks made by Professor Dale Fisher, chair of the World Health Organisation\u2019s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.  +Neither is there evidence to show that the young are vectors or spreaders of the virus,+ he said. +The reverse appears to be the case, where the young get infected by adults at home.+  None of the students in Singapore who contracted Covid-19 caught it from school, he added.  +In this context, it may not be a bad idea for our children to spend the bulk of their day in school, where lessons and activities are arranged such that they mingle only with their classmates, who are less susceptible to the virus than adults,+ Mr Ong said.  +They will be quite a resilient group. If we close schools, many will not stay home, but may run around in the community and mingle with a lot more people, exposing themselves to more risk.+  The minister also said closing schools would also disrupt the lives of many people, particularly parents who are both working, and who have limited childcare options.  +We are particularly concerned about parents who are healthcare workers and providers of essential services.+  Related Story Children less likely to be sick from Covid-19: Professor  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Various measures will help keep students safe, he said, pointing to the Government+s existing leave of absence and stay-home notice policy, as well as checks on people+s travel history at school gates, which will be done as an extra precaution.  Students will also only spend their time with those in their classes, with co-curricular activities suspended for two weeks.  They will sit apart in class and be reminded to wash their hands regularly and avoid touching their faces.  Those who are not feeling well - be it with a cough or sore throat - will be placed in an isolation room or sent home, he added.  +Implemented together, these measures will serve as a robust layer of system defence, complementing the natural defence children may already have, to enable school to continue,+ he said.","2":"Children appear to be asymptomatic or less likely to be sick from Covid-19 than adults, which is why there is no real reason to close schools for now, says Professor Dale Fisher, group director of medicine at the National University Health System and chair of the World Health Organisation+s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.  He shares more.  Q Why do children seem to be less affected by Covid-19 than adults?  A We know that there are other diseases where children are not affected as much. For instance, chicken pox is a much milder illness in children than in adults.  And a child with Hepatitis A (a viral liver disease) probably does not have symptoms, but they might have antibodies if you test them, whereas adults with Hepatitis A will develop fever and jaundice.  So, we know that children and adults have a different sort of immune system. The children could be - for reasons we do not yet understand - less likely to have symptoms.  If studies done to find out if children have antibodies to Covid-19 show that there are a lot of asymptomatic children, it will prove - but it will not tell us why - that children are getting infected but not showing symptoms.  Q Should we worry about children passing Covid-19 to the elderly?  A That is another question we do not yet know the answer to. However, if they are asymptomatic, they are less likely to do so.  In fact, a lot of the swabs that we have taken from family clusters have shown that while the parents might have had the disease and had symptoms, the children are completely well, even though they tested positive.  We have no evidence that the child in those family clusters was the first person to get it.  If you are asymptomatic, you are much less likely to spread it because you are not coughing, you are not making the droplets. Is it theoretically possible to spread it if you share a pair of chopsticks, for instance? We think it is probably theoretically possible, but it is certainly not a major driver of the outbreak. The money is on people with symptoms spreading the disease before they are diagnosed and isolated.  It is more the other way around - the parents have infected the child and the child is asymptomatic, but you can find (the virus) in their throat.  If you are asymptomatic, you are much less likely to spread it because you are not coughing, you are not making the droplets.  Is it theoretically possible to spread it if you share a pair of chopsticks, for instance?  We think it is probably theoretically possible, but it is certainly not a major driver of the outbreak.  The money is on people with symptoms spreading the disease before they are diagnosed and isolated.  So, if that period is a week, they are going to spread it a lot. If it is two days, they will not spread it so much.  If it is two days where they stayed home because they were not feeling well, then they will spread the disease to even fewer people, or to no one.  We know that younger people are unlikely to get serious illness, but they can be an important part of transmission and every young person in Singapore has parents and grandparents who are older.  Everyone needs to pull together to do their part, to help save lives.","3":"SINGAPORE - More than 4,000 people in Singapore have been infected with dengue fever this year - double the number of cases reported for the same period in 2019.  The surge in cases, ahead of the traditional peak dengue season between June and October, has been fuelled by several factors - the rise of a less common dengue virus serotype, as well as warmer temperatures and more rain which have caused the population of the Aedes aegypti mosquito to multiply.  +This unusually high number of cases outside the typical peak dengue period is a cause for concern for all of us. Entering the warmer months of the year, there could be more instances of transmission,+ said Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli at the launch of the National Dengue Prevention Campaign in Ang Mo Kio on Sunday (March 22).  The National Environment Agency+s (NEA) annual campaign typically begins in April or May, but was started earlier this year in view of the grimmer dengue outlook.  The island has seen 300 to 400 new cases a week since the start of the year. There are now about 100 active dengue clusters across the island, including 28 +red+ clusters which have at least 10 cases of the mosquito-transmitted virus. Parts of Jurong West and Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 are within these high-risk areas.  Dengue fever is caused by four different virus serotypes, or strains. Outbreaks here tend to be caused by the DENV-1 serotype as well as DENV-2, the main dengue virus serotype in the island since 2016.  But DENV-3 infections have been rising in the past four months. In February, they made up 48 per cent of cases, almost double the 26 per cent for DENV-2 cases.  Mr Masagos said that since Singapore has not had a dengue outbreak driven by DENV-3 in almost three decades, the population+s immunity to this particular serotype is lower.  It is +still too early+ to tell if there has been a switch of predominant dengue virus type, and the NEA is monitoring the situation closely, he added.  Related Story Dengue outbreak possible with rise of DenV-3, a virus type not dominant in more than 30 years  Related Story NEA boosts dengue fight with new mozzie breeding facility  +We have a less common dengue virus serotype emerging and lower immunity against it, and second, we have more Aedes mosquitoes carrying this virus. This has resulted in a higher number of dengue cases, which in turn increases the chances of dengue transmission. So that is the third reason for the surge in dengue cases we are seeing...+  +If the three factors I mentioned persist, this number could rise beyond the historical weekly peak of 891 cases recorded in July 2014, during the peak season.+  Dengue fever, which can cause a very high fever, severe headache and joint and muscle pains, claimed 20 lives last year.  The NEA has been taking steps to fight dengue, Mr Masagos said.  From January to February, it conducted 161,000 inspections in public areas and housing estates and discovered about 3,200 mosquito breeding habitats, most of which were in people+s homes.  At the start of the year, the environment agency also laid 14,000 Gravitraps in newly completed Housing Board blocks and landed housing estates. More than 64,000 of these devices islandwide trap adult female Aedes mosquitoes that are looking for places to lay their eggs, and also stop young mosquitoes in these traps from emerging.  +With better surveillance and analytics capabilities,+ Mr Masagos added, +we have observed a 90 per cent increase in the detection rate of Aedes larval habitats found in homes for the past three years.+  But everyone must continue to do their part to keep the community safe, he said.  +In some of the large dengue clusters, NEA had detected repeated mosquito breeding in the same homes despite giving multiple alerts to residents. I therefore appeal to residents to do your part to remove potential breeding habitats in your homes, to keep you and our communities safe.+  People are encouraged to reduce the spread of dengue - for example by ensuring that stagnant water does not gather in potential mosquito breeding areas such as flower-pot plates, pails and litter such as discarded drink cans. Aedes mosquitoes can breed in bodies of stagnant water as small as a 20-cent coin.  Over the past three years, more than 3,000 mosquito breeding habitats have been linked to containers and receptacles that were mostly discarded as litter in public areas.  Mr Masagos added that the SG Clean campaign launched last month +addresses the immediate risks from Covid-19, (but) also sets out to improve public hygiene and cleanliness for the long term+.  The NEA is also putting up posters in HDB lift lobbies to inform residents of upcoming inspections - as well as insecticide spraying - for all homes in dengue clusters.  +I ask for your cooperation with NEA officers. Let them carry out the checks and spraying in your homes. We should also inform our family, neighbours and friends about these efforts so that they are aware and lend support,+ the minister added.  Grassroots leader Eric Chua, 44, chairman of Yio Chu Kang Zone 3 RC, leads a team of volunteers who go door-to-door to raise awareness of the disease. Volunteers visit homes two times a year \u2013 and three or four times if these are in more high-risk areas.  He said: \u201cAng Mo Kio is a mature estate. There are many seniors, and some are staying alone. Sometimes it can be a bit challenging to spread the message to them as well. Youngsters have a lot of platforms for information \u2013 such as social media \u2013 but some seniors may not know the seriousness (of the situation).\u201d  He stressed the importance of taking precautions \u2013 even as public attention has been occupied by the coronavirus outbreak in Singapore.  IT technician Viknesh Jayasekaran, 34, who lives near a high-risk dengue cluster in Ang Mo Kio, takes the usual precautions \u2013 leaving pails upturned and emptying water from the plates below plant pots \u2013 even as he said he is more worried about the coronavirus.  ","4":"An appeal by the authorities for businesses to implement stricter and mandatory social distancing to contain the spread of the coronavirus gained some momentum yesterday as a number of restaurants, hotels, supermarkets, nightclubs and cinemas put in place measures to keep customers farther apart.  A Golden Village (GV) cinemas spokesman said its managers will be putting in place measures as required by the authorities.  +On top of what GV has already implemented on the compulsory seat gap, we will be blocking out more seats in all our cinema halls,+ he added.  Several tables at the Shake Shack hamburger joint in Neil Road were marked with a cross and left empty to seat patrons farther apart. A staff member checked the temperatures of customers before allowing them to stay in line to wait for their tables.  The hamburger joint+s branch at Jewel in Changi Airport had black tape on the floor placed a metre apart so people could keep a distance while queueing.  +We should do whatever we can in making sure the epidemic curve is flattened,+ said university student Gayya Subra, 26, who was in the queue. She was referring to the popular theory of slowing down the infection rate so that healthcare systems will not be overwhelmed, buying time for interventions, such as a vaccine to be made.  Nightclub Zouk, which remains open, is limiting its capacity in each of its four venues to 250 people, including staff. Each room has its own stamp to ensure that guests do not move from room to room - a policy that started on Friday.  STRICTER RULES  The Government announced stricter guidelines on Friday, suspending all events and gatherings with 250 or more participants until June 30, while the suspension of all social activities for seniors by government agencies will be extended for another two weeks until April 7.  Events with fewer than 250 people and operators of venues such as restaurants and cinemas must implement measures to ensure separation of at least a metre between patrons. The measures will apply across the board for all events, including religious and private gatherings.  Retailers and food and beverage outlets will also be required to keep patrons at least a metre apart. For instance, operators are encouraged to demarcate queues to ensure patrons keep their distance while dining outlets should ensure alternate seats are marked out.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  The Government said the measures were mandatory and would be enforced.  The exhortations did not go unnoticed.  At a wedding at The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore, newly-weds who would identify themselves only as Mr and Mrs Tan split their guests into two groups - one in the ballroom and the other in an area outside.  The tables were also placed at least a metre apart and they each had only about six guests instead of the usual 10. Guests were also served food on individual plates so there was no sharing.  +We do feel safe attending the wedding,+ said guest Nur+Ashikin Ahmad, a 32-year-old accountant, who turned up with her husband and two-year-old daughter.  Some restaurants even cancelled reservations to avoid overcrowding. Michelin-starred Burnt Ends rang yesterday morning to turn away at least one group of guests as it needed to keep patrons a metre apart, which meant it could not have the usual number of tables.  Customer Chelsea Lim, who had her reservation cancelled, told The Sunday Times: +It+s good they do this and show everyone that it+s possible for F&B businesses to do something to tackle the virus too.+  Ms Lim, 29, thought the one-metre rule was a good thing and that it was better +to be safe than sorry in this climate+.  RESPONSE PATCHY  However, the measures did not sit well everywhere and appeared generally patchy because people still huddled close together whether they were standing in queues or dining in restaurants.  Related Story How some countries are using social distancing to limit coronavirus spread  Lunch tables at Jack+s Place at Bras Basah Complex were all filled with no empty table in between different groups of diners.  Mr Chui Miang Chew, 66, who runs a yong tau foo stall at the People+s Park Complex Food Centre, said he was afraid that some customers might be unhappy if he told them to keep the one-metre distance while queueing to buy food.  +It+s hard for me to dictate how they queue,+ Mr Chui told The Sunday Times in Mandarin. +Some customers don+t like it when the hawkers tell them what to do.+  He added that during peak hours there could be 40 or 50 customers in the queue.  +Keeping one metre between the patrons is difficult. Where+s the queue going to go?  +It+s still possible to do it here as there is some space, but some other hawker centres are even more cramped.+  Most customers at the centre seemed aware of the new safe distancing measures and opted to be seated on seats that were not marked with a cross, which placed them farther away from friends and family members.  However, such measures left some retailers worried as having more empty space meant fewer tables, chairs and ultimately customers.

Work pass holders and their dependants will be allowed to return to Singapore only if they work in sectors that provide essential services such as healthcare and transport.  This will also kick in at 11.59pm on Monday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a statement on Sunday.  The measures were announced a day after two patients - a 75-year-old Singaporean woman and a 64-year-old Indonesian man - died from Covid-19 due to complications. They were the first deaths the Republic has seen in the Covid-19 outbreak.  National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said at a briefing on Sunday morning that the measures to +significantly tighten+ Singapore+s borders are taken in the light of the rapidly escalating virus outbreak around the world.  Previously, except for a handful of countries, short-term visitors from elsewhere were allowed to come into Singapore but were issued a 14-day stay-home notice (SHN) upon arrival.  This meant, however, that resources were being expended to serve and enforce SHNs on them, and if they fell ill, to provide them with medical treatment. On Saturday, there were still 533 short-term visitors arriving in Singapore.  To date, there are more than 260,000 Covid-19 cases across 185 countries, and around 11,200 deaths.  The MOH said that in Singapore, almost 80 per cent of new Covid-19 cases over the past three days were imported, most of them Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning home from abroad.  These imported cases had travel histories to 22 different countries.  There were 432 cases of coronavirus patients in Singapore as of Saturday evening. A total of 140 cases have fully recovered. Of the 290 patients still in hospital, most are stable or improving, but 14 are in critical care.  On the limited entry for work pass holders and their dependants, the Manpower Ministry will allow this only for those in essential services.  On what constitutes essential services, Mr Wong said the Ministry of Manpower will continue to approve applications for the workers to come back according to existing rules, with inputs from relevant government agencies when needed.  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore residents who travel overseas may face consequences as Govt ramps up border controls  He added that foreign domestic helpers could also be considered as offering essential services, especially in cases where they are needed to help look after children or the elderly.  As previously announced, all Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders returning will continue to be issued a 14-day SHN.  In addition, Malaysians with Singapore work permits can continue to work in the Republic during this period, with accommodation arrangements.  Transport of goods between both countries will also be facilitated, the Singapore-Malaysia Special Working Committee has agreed.  Diplomats accredited and based in Singapore can continue to come in. They will also be subjected to the 14-day isolation.  On Sunday, Mr Wong said that these were very significant moves especially for a small open economy like Singapore which has always been connected to the world.  +But this is an unprecedented crisis,+ he said.  He noted that while very few short-term visitors have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, they can take up enforcement and medical resources.  +During this time, we have to focus our resources on returning Singaporeans,+ he said.  On how long these measure will remain in place, he said: +I can+t say at this stage. No one will know how long this current wave of imported cases we are experiencing will last for.+  He added: +It depends on how long the outbreak is going to continue in Europe and America, which are now the new epicentres for the virus outbreak. It (also) depends on how long more we will see returning Singaporeans coming back, so we will monitor on a day by day basis.+  Mr Wong also warned that the Government is considering measures against those who choose to travel overseas despite the border control measures.  +I don+t think we can allow this to continue. We are discussing what additional measures may be needed,+ he said, adding that work pass holders who leave Singapore at this time may face the consequence of not being allowed entry later.  In recent days, most of the new patients in Singapore have been imported cases, that is, returning residents and long-term pass holders with travel history to Europe, North America, South-east Asia and other parts of Asia.  Besides strict border controls, rigorous contact tracing, quarantine and home isolation, the Government has implemented safe distancing measures such as smaller crowd sizes and keeping safe spaces around individuals, especially vulnerable segments of the population like the elderly.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  For example, all events and gatherings with 250 or more participants are to be suspended until June 30, while the suspension of all social activities for seniors by government agencies will be extended for another two weeks until April 7.

He said this will not only help people in the long-term, but it will also help the fight Covid-19 if they get it.  In his opening remarks at the briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, he included the following health tips:  First, eat a health and nutritious diet, which helps your immune system to function properly.  Second, limit your alcohol consumption, and avoid sugary drinks.  Third, do not smoke, he said, as smoking damages your lungs and can increase your risk of developing severe disease if you become infected with Covid-19.  Fourth, exercise. WHO recommends 30 minutes of physical activity a day for adults, and one hour a day for children.  If allowed, go outside for a walk or a run, while keeping a safe distance from others.  If you cannot leave the house, find an exercise video online, dance to music, do some yoga, or walk up and down the stairs.

Get your information from reliable sources once or twice a day.+  In the same set of remarks, Dr Tedros said: +One of the things we are learning is that although older people are the hardest hit, younger people are not spared.  +Data from many countries clearly show that people under 50 make up a significant proportion of patients requiring hospitalisation.+  At the start of last week, he had warned that although the evidence they have suggests that those over 60 are at highest risk, young people, including children, have died.","7":"SINGAPORE - Madam Jayamani Viswalingam, 64, has been going to the Sri Siva Durga Temple in Potong Pasir for over 30 years, so a global pandemic is not going to stop her weekly Tuesday prayers.

But for some, like Madam Viswalingam, there are a few more steps, like taking her temperature at home before going to the temple to prepare a tray of lime lamps - limes that have been scooped out and filled with a wick and ghee - to offer to the goddess Durga.","8":"SINGAPORE - The bodies of those infected with Covid-19 will be prepared for cremation or burial by healthcare workers in hospitals as part of a set guidelines issued by the National Environment Agency (NEA).  The protocols include double-bagging the bodies before they are placed in airtight coffins.  The agency has also issued guidelines to funeral directories and parlours for additional precautionary measures at funerals and wakes. These include limiting the number of attendees to below 250 and implementing social distancing.  The guidelines have taken on more resonance following the deaths of two patients on Saturday morning (March 21 ) - a 75-year-old Singaporean woman and a 64-year-old Indonesian man - due to Covid-19 complications.  They are the first deaths Singapore has seen from the outbreak.  The guidelines on the handling of bodies were issued by NEA in consultation with the Health Ministry (MOH) on Feb 7 to relevant funeral services companies.  The agency also stated that collecting, casketing and transporting bodies for cremation or burial will be restricted to companies whose employees have undergone the basic infection control course by the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.  Funeral service company employees are to be properly protected when they carry out their work.  Funerals and wakes for those who died of Covid-19 are allowed as long as there is no contact with the body, said NEA.  +However, to minimise any risk posed by contact between potentially large number of visitors during the wake, families will be advised to keep the funeral wakes short,+ said NEA, adding that families should also abide by the latest MOH guidelines on events and gatherings involving large groups of participants at any one time.  In the light of this, NEA has also asked funeral services companies to offer other options to families, such as holding prayers just before the cremation, for example, at the service hall in Mandai Crematorium.  Burials are allowed if there are strong religious reasons for it, added NEA.  There is a list of funeral services companies that are able and willing to handle the bodies of those infected with Covid-19. Hospitals will advise affected families when such information is required, said NEA.  If the dead patient is a foreigner, families can cremate the body and transport the ashes back to their home countries. No special permit is needed to repatriate cremated ashes.  On Friday, NEA also issued advisories to funeral directories and parlours to implement additional measures at funerals and wakes, including temperature screenings, visitor registration and safe distancing measures.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  For example, gatherings in funeral or wake spaces should be limited to less than 250 people at any one time and there needs to be physical spacing of at least 1m between attendees.  The agency also discouraged buffets and said operators should consider alternative arrangements such as individual bento sets.  The NEA-managed Mandai Crematorium will implement staggered seating at its service halls and funeral directors are advised to tell families to keep attendees to below 50 people.

Out of this number, 73 were work-pass holders with travel history to countries affected by Covid-19 and who entered Singapore without obtaining entry approval from MOM.  These countries refer to places from which travellers would be required to serve a 14-day SHN upon arrival in Singapore.  Another 16 work-pass holders were caught breaching the Leave of Absence (LOA) or SHN requirements.  MOM said in a statement that some were caught working at their workplaces.  Others were caught leaving their place of residence during the period of their LOA or SHN, even when instructed not to do so.  +Many of these violations occurred during the first month following the imposition of the SHN requirement. In the second month, the number of violations fell to four,+ MOM said.  SHN was introduced in February, initially covering those with travel history from mainland China.  The workers have been permanently banned from working in Singapore.

MOM said employers are reminded to seek approval using the online facility for work-pass holders to enter or return to Singapore.  +Employers should inform their employees not to make travel plans to Singapore until approval has been obtained from MOM,+ it added.  When the employee arrives, the person will also be required to serve the 14-day mandatory SHN.  +Employers and employees have a joint duty to ensure that the employee behaves responsibly during the SHN,+ MOM said.  +MOM will continue to take enforcement measures against errant employers or employees who do not comply with the requirements set out above, including the revocation of work passes and suspension of work-pass privileges.+","10":"SINGAPORE - All doctors in public and private hospitals, as well as private specialist clinics, have been advised by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to immediately stop or defer accepting new foreign patients who do not reside in Singapore.  They have also been instructed to encourage their current foreign patients to seek continued care in their home countries.  An internal circular issued by the MOH to private and public healthcare institutions on Thursday (March 19), which was seen by The Straits Times, said it was necessary +to conserve limited healthcare resources for Singapore to cater to managing Covid-19 cases as well as the existing needs of our local patients.+  The circular said the latest measures will last until further advised by the MOH.  +Failure of the specialist to comply with the above may adversely impact public health and safety, and as such, will result in more stringent considerations of subsequent applications by MOH,+ the circular said.  Singapore reported its first two deaths from the coronavirus on Saturday. On Friday, officials confirmed 40 new Covid-19 cases, bringing the total number of infected patients on the island to 385. A carpark at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) was converted on Friday to help screen patients for fever to help alleviate the load on the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.  The contents of the circular on Thursday provided guidance on the approach doctors should take when managing foreign patients holding Asean passports who are seeking specialist medical care in the country.  The circular added that specialists who feel it is necessary for a foreign patient to remain in Singapore can apply to the MOH for a waiver.  To qualify, the patient must have healthcare needs that cannot be met in his home country and be already under the specialist+s active care. The specialist must certify that delays in the treatment of the patient will lead to +serious adverse outcomes+, the circular said.  Related Story Coronavirus: Asean travellers rush to enter Singapore before border restrictions affecting them kick in  Other foreign patients who live in Asean and wish to have continued specialist care in Singapore must apply for the Asean Health Clearance (AHC) prior to their medical appointment.  They must not have visited any hospital outside Singapore 14 days before the application to be eligible for the AHC.  From Monday (March 16), the Government said that the AHC has to be submitted by all short-term visitors who are Asean nationals at least 14 to 21 days before their intended date of travel into Singapore, and should be approved by the MOH before they begin their trip to Singapore.  These approved applications will be verified by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority at the border.  However, the circular also noted that in some cases of medical emergencies involving the evacuation of Asean passport holders, the requirement for the AHC can be waived.  MOH had earlier announced that all travellers entering the Republic from 11.59pm on Friday (March 20) will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice.  Short-term visitors who arrive in the country without the necessary approval, or proof of the place where they will serve their 14-day stay-home notice, or do not meet prevailing entry requirements, will be unable to enter Singapore.","11":"SINGAPORE - Singaporean John Png, 44, is glad he stayed put in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus pandemic erupted.

The Ministry of Health had announced measures to reduce the risk of local transmission of the coronavirus, including requiring public venues like eateries, shops and cinemas to keep patrons at least 1m apart.  Though the measures were to be rolled out progressively from Saturday, preparations had already begun at several businesses.  Casual restaurant chain Collin+s has already moved out around 10 per cent of its tables in its Nex shopping mall outlet to ensure adequate spacing between groups of diners.  Mr Jonathan Lim, 48, chief development officer at SF Group, Collin+s parent company, said: +It+s a bit of a sacrifice and dine-in business has been impacted slightly. But we try to cope by having more offers to draw customers to dine during off-peak hours.+  Chinese restaurant Soup Restaurant managing director Wong Wei Teck, 64, similarly said it started implementing the 1m safety distance and collecting diners+ details for contact tracing at two of its 15 outlets. It intends to implement the measures at all outlets by the end of next week.  +We+re a family restaurant and we frequently get big groups. It can be little bit troublesome for customers but it+s safety first,+ said Mr Wong.  Meanwhile, Koi operations project manager Lim Zhi Liang, 34, said that at outlets with self-order touchscreen kiosks, staff will space them at least 1m apart and disinfect the touchscreens every 15 to 30 minutes. Floor markers will be rolled out across all 57 outlets over the next few days.  Over at Zouk in Clarke Quay, the nightspot is limiting the capacity in each of its four venues - Zouk main room, Capital, Phuture and Redtail - to 250 people each, including staff. Guest information will also be collected for contact tracing.  Mr Seah Kian Peng, group chief executive of FairPrice Group, said that 1m floor markers at the checkout counters and storewide announcements every 30 minutes to remind customers to space themselves would be progressively implemented at all 148 FairPrice outlets. He said, however, that there are no plans at the moment to limit the number of shoppers in stores.  NEA and town councils are also in the process of marking out seats at hawker centres to guide patrons on how to practise safe distancing.  To help businesses comply with the new requirements, Enterprise Singapore, the National Environment Agency, the Singapore Food Agency and the Singapore Tourism Board issued two joint advisories on Friday with steps the firms can take.  For instance, it said retail shops may use floor markers, along with clear signage, to indicate queuing positions for fitting rooms and at cashiers.  Shops may also limit the number of people within the store and let shoppers in progressively though supermarkets are advised not to create queues outside their stores.  Food and beverage establishments were advised to reduce queues outside their outlets by taking down diners+ details and calling them when seats are available. If not possible, the 1m floor markers, with clear signage, should be used to manage the crowd.    A staff at Koi at Nex in Serangoon places a customer+s order on a designated area on the counter on March 20, 2020.

A government spokesman at a multi-ministry task force briefing on Friday also said no lockdown is expected in the near future.  There has been an increase in false reports posted and reposted online since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in recent months, with the Government having to make use of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act to clamp down on rumours several times.  In January, two Facebook accounts were told to make corrections to posts claiming that Woodlands MRT station was closed for disinfection because of a suspected Covid-19 case.  SPH Magazines was also asked in January to correct an online post in the HardwareZone forum that falsely claimed a man in Singapore had died from the virus infection, while The States Times Review Facebook page in the same month was instructed to correct a post that claimed Singapore had run out of face masks.","18":"SINGAPORE - A contact-tracing smartphone app has been launched to allow the local authorities to quickly track people who have been exposed to confirmed coronavirus cases.  Dubbed TraceTogether, the app is able to identify people who have been in close proximity - within 2m for at least 30 minutes - to coronavirus patients using wireless Bluetooth technology, said its developers, the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) and the Ministry of Health (MOH), on Friday (March 20).  +This is especially useful in cases where the infected persons do not know everyone whom they had been in close proximity with for an extended duration,+ said its developers.  While use of the app is not compulsory, those who use it have to turn on the Bluetooth settings in their phones for tracing to be done. They also need to enable push notifications and location permissions in the app, which is available on the Apple App Store or the Google Play store.  Should one of these users be infected, MOH will be able to quickly find out which other users they have been in close contact with, allowing for easier identification of potential cases and helping to curb the spread of the coronavirus here.  On its website, TraceTogether+s developers said the app is meant to complement current contact-tracing methods and allow for the identification of people who were in close proximity with an infected person more efficiently. There is currently no target for the number of users for the app.  In a release on Friday, the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO) said users have to give explicit consent to participate in TraceTogether, and for their mobile number and data to be used for contact tracing.  +When requested by MOH, users can send their TraceTogether logs to facilitate the contact tracing process. Up to that point, the authorities, including MOH and GovTech, have no knowledge of the user+s TraceTogether data,+ said SNDGO.  Official contact tracers will provide a code that users can match with a corresponding verification code on their app. Once authenticated, users will be given a PIN that allows submission of logs when entered.  Official contact tracers will also not ask for any personal financial details or request for the transfer of money over the phone.  When contacted by contact tracers, that is the point that users will be asked to share their data logs. If they refuse, they may be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act.  Related Story Interactive: How coronavirus is spreading across the world  On its website, TraceTogether developers said that keeping the app running all the time will not drain a phone+s battery significantly.  The only data that is collected by the Government through this app is the user+s mobile number, which is kept so that MOH can contact users quickly if they were in close proximity with an infected case.  The app also does not collect or use users+ location data, but only records who they might have been close to.  Similar apps have been said to be successful in helping to turn the tide against the coronavirus in some countries.  In highly-connected South Korea, for instance, people know quickly when a new coronavirus case is found in their neighbourhood through a government alert sent to their mobile phones. This alert includes details such as the new patient+s age, gender and travel history.    Scan the QR code to download the TraceTogether app.    The World Health Organisation and experts said that the country+s extensive tracing, testing and isolation measures have helped to significantly reduce the virus+s spread.

This is to safeguard seniors+ well-being amid the Covid-19 outbreak, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong on Friday (March 20).  All organisers of other activities that involve physical interactions among seniors should also suspend their plans until April 7.  The move is part of a range of stricter social-distancing measures announced by Mr Gan.  +Flattening the curve will help our patients continue to get the best care that they can, and a particular group that we are concerned about is our seniors, including myself,+ said Mr Gan, who is co-chair of a government task force to fight the coronavirus.  +In addition to these safe distancing measures, we advise seniors to avoid crowded places,+ he added.  He noted that according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), individuals who are older or have underlying conditions such as heart disease or diabetes have a higher risk of severe Covid-19 infection.  The suspension applies to all activities organised by community clubs, residents+ committees, senior activity centres, active ageing hubs, Crest centres, the Health Promotion Board and ActiveSG sport centres.  National Silver Academy (NSA) courses and volunteer programmes administered by the Council for Third Age have also been suspended for the same duration.

Before it was blocked to Singapore users, the offending post was criticised by several people on Facebook in their comments.  User Christopher Njo said the page had crossed a line with something that many people treat as holy and sacred, and said he hoped Facebook would remove the post.  +It is ignorant and insensitive people like you who cause unnecessary tensions and problems,+ he said.  Another commenter Alex Lin said the post was inciting hatred.  In a statement on its website, the Humanist Society (Singapore) said the post was \u201cneither reasoned nor compassionate\u201d and unhelpful given the ongoing Covid-19 situation, which it said affects all regardless of race or religion.  \u201cWe would like to encourage productive and rational dialogue during this crisis. We should focus on disseminating facts, providing comfort, and promoting public unity amidst the pandemic,\u201d it said.  In a post providing more information on the group dated December 2015, the page, which has about 1,000 followers, said there is no official atheist group in NUS.  It also made reference to Christopher Hitchens, the late prominent British-American intellectual who wrote, among other works, the book God Is Not Great.

In December 2008, a fire broke out in the wheel control room, causing 173 passengers to be trapped for about six hours.  In July 2010, the ride was also shut down and more than 200 passengers were evacuated after lightning struck one of its electrical cables that supplied power to the air-conditioning systems.

It was helter-skelter after Malaysia announced a two-week national lockdown on Monday night. The disorder was not just over there but also in Singapore because of the close ties between the two countries.  Students and workers scrambled across the Causeway to beat the lockdown deadline as employers here sought lodgings for their workers.  Like China and Italy, Malaysia has taken drastic action to counter a surge in coronavirus cases, mostly linked to a mass religious event in late February.  When asked if Singapore would consider such a move, which is also in place in France and being considered in London, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong told a press conference on Tuesday that while he could not rule it out, it was not on the cards.  Observers and public health experts say the chaos that ensued after Malaysia+s lockdown showed why such a measure would be warranted only if the outbreak gets out of hand and the benefits outweigh the costs.  Dr Gillian Koh, deputy director for research at the Institute of Policy Studies, told The New Paper: +Singapore+s survival and sustainability depends on borders being open and receiving goods as well as people.  +So the cost of locking down Singapore is very high, both for the economy and for sustaining daily life itself.+  But a recent spike in the number of infections has led to online ire and frustration over people here going on holidays despite advisories to defer non-essential travel.  A record 47 new cases were reported on Wednesday, of which 30 were Singapore residents returning from abroad.  Yesterday, for the first time in five days, the number of new cases dropped, as 32 infections were confirmed, of which 24 were imported, all involving returning Singapore residents.  Arguing why a lockdown was highly unlikely, Dr Koh said: +Even with returning Singaporeans, we have very stringent protocols and all of us do expect them to abide by them... to ensure that we keep the extreme scenario of a lockdown as far away as possible.+  National University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser said it was understandable that Singaporeans felt negatively towards people they deemed socially irresponsible.  Singapore Management University law don Eugene Tan agreed but felt these sentiments would weaken after the outbreak.  Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, infectious diseases programme leader at Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at NUS, said a lockdown is a +nuclear option+ reserved for when community transmission has to be brought under control quickly.  While this seems to have worked for China, which yesterday saw zero new infections in Hubei province for the first time since the virus emerged there, Prof Hsu said lockdowns cannot be done indefinitely.  With the virus spreading in so many countries, it could also still be re-imported.  Whether an outbreak is severe enough to warrant such an extreme measure depends on how much each society can tolerate its costs, said Prof Hsu.  +Sometimes that price is far higher than what the virus can do,+ he added.  TESTING CAPACITY  Making a comparison with South Korea+s approach, which involved expanding its testing capacity rapidly and implementing strict social distancing, Prof Hsu said each country had to find the right balance and use its strengths where possible to control the outbreak.  +We are fortunate that community transmission is low at present, and there is more leeway in terms of what we can do,+ he added.  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore General Hospital to convert part of carpark into fever screening area  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam said it is thanks to the hard work put in earlier during the outbreak that a lockdown is not needed here.  Prof Hsu said what Singapore is doing now is to try to prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed at its current capacity, or what is known as flattening the curve.  But at the same time, he said Singapore can also prepare for a possible surge and try to expand healthcare capacity.  He suggested training people to take over some of the work done by nurses so they can be freed up for other tasks.  +For the regular patients... they can just be isolated in a facility where they can+t transmit the virus but can be monitored and taken care of in a way that doesn+t require the heavy resources of a hospital bed or an isolation room,+ Prof Hsu said.  Dr Leong was optimistic that Singapore could maintain its efforts in fighting the virus over the next three to six months but warned against complacency.  Reminding the public to stay home if unwell and urging them to defer travel plans, he said: +We have all the necessary ingredients to overcome this outbreak. But all this is hanging precariously. If we are not careful, it can be lost at the drop of a hat.+  LISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST","25":"SINGAPORE - Malaysians with Singapore work permits can continue to work in Singapore with health screening and accommodation arrangements made for them, while food and products will continue to be transported across the border smoothly.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Friday (March 20) that Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean spoke with Malaysian Senior Minister and Minister of Defence Ismail Sabri Yaakob on the phone on Thursday to discuss these issues in light of Malaysia+s two-week movement restriction order.  The two Senior Ministers discussed the arrangements to ensure the health of the citizens on both sides of the border, while minimising disruptions to companies, workers and citizens.  The MFA said that Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri assured Mr Teo that Malaysia will facilitate the smooth transport of food, while both sides will ensure the transport of commercial goods across the land checkpoint.  At a separate news conference is Malaysia, the Malaysian minister said: \u201cI understand there were discussions. And both sides have agreed that all workers will continue to work there. The Singapore government has agreed to set up accommodation for them in Singapore for two weeks. So they will go to Singapore and stay at the accommodation prepared for them and when they return to Malaysia. Singapore will screen them.\u201d  Both Senior Ministers are chairing the Special Working Committee on the Covid-19 crisis and agreed to establish three working groups under the committee to coordinate the movement of people, goods and the daily operational issues at land checkpoints.  The Straits Times reported a day earlier that Malaysia would temporarily lift the travel ban on citizens who commute to Singapore for work, on the condition that they are housed on the island for the duration of Malaysia+s ongoing restricted movement order.  Malaysia closed its borders for two weeks on Wednesday in an attempt to curb its rising number of coronavirus cases. All Malaysians have been barred from travelling overseas, including around 300,000 daily travellers who commute to Singapore on a near daily basis for work or study.  With today\u2019s announcement, those with long term passes will now be allowed to leave the country, provided they do not return during the two-week period.  As of Friday, Malaysia has over 1,000 confirmed cases, with two deaths.

Employers who place their staff on this voluntary LOA will be able to claim daily support under a programme by the MOM aimed at alleviating the companies+ financial burden during the Covid-19 outbreak.  This initiative follows recent, stricter measures imposed by schools to curb the spread of the coronavirus, after more infections and a surge in imported cases were recorded in Singapore.  All students and staff who returned from overseas between last Saturday (March 14) and this Friday will be put on a mandatory 14-day leave of absence from the date of return.  From 11.59pm on Friday, all arriving travellers, including Singaporeans, will face even more stringent measures and will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice.  This means they will not be able to leave their homes for 14 days.  In encouraging companies to voluntarily impose the LOA on Friday, the MOM said: +The Government recognises that many parents have been affected by this national measure due to the need to provide care for their children during this period.  +At the same time, it is a useful precautionary measure for people who have travelled recently to stay away from the workplace to prevent further transmission.+  The MOM said companies should adopt flexible work arrangements to allow these employees to work from home during that whole 14-day period.  It noted that some companies had already voluntarily asked employees to stay home after returning from trips overseas between last Saturday and Friday.  Such companies should continue with existing flexible work and leave arrangements, including asking their employees to use their annual leave to cover the company imposed LOA, said the MOM.  However, for those companies that have not put such measures in place, +employers are encouraged to provide additional paid leave to the employees, if work from home is not feasible+, considering that the LOA option was not known before their employees travelled.  To help these companies, the MOM will allow them to apply for the $100 daily support under the LOA support programme, which covers only employees who are Singaporeans, permanent residents or work pass holders.  Companies can also claim a levy waiver for their affected work pass holders.  Those who are self-employed and who have to put themselves on LOA will similarly be allowed to claim this daily support.  Eligible employers will be able to apply for daily support for each affected employee after their LOA is completed.  However, employers, self-employed Singaporeans and permanent residents will not be able to claim under the support programme if they worked remotely during the LOA period or if the affected employee had to use his or her own annual leave, childcare leave or any other kind of leave to cover the LOA.  Additionally, those who have been placed on stay-home notice upon returning to Singapore and whose travel was not between March 14 to 20 are not eligible for daily support under this programme.  Said the MOM: +As the Covid-19 situation continues to evolve, there may be additional requirements imposed on work pass holders from time to time.+  It urged employers and employees to check the MOM website for the latest advisories.  LISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST","27":"SINGAPORE - Singapore saw fewer job vacancies overall last year but there were still many opportunities in growth sectors, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on Friday (March 20). Going forward, however, the uncertainties this year amid the coronavirus outbreak mean vacancies are likely to fall further, she said.  +Hiring sentiments have weakened which means job seekers will have a more challenging time,+ said Mrs Teo in a Facebook post on the Ministry of Manpower+s report on job vacancies in 2019, released on Friday.  The report showed that despite economic uncertainties, like the United States-China trade war, that resulted in fewer job vacancies, employers were still creating new jobs through business expansion and formation.  A total of 42 per cent of the 52,900 openings available last September were newly created positions from business expansion or formation. The proportion was the same as in the previous year, though the number of openings was lower than the 63,300 available in September 2018.  For this year, Mrs Teo said: +The focus must be to help as many people as possible stay in their current jobs. We can then direct job matching support to those who need it most.  +This is similar to our approach in handling the public health crisis - keep most people away from hospitals, so healthcare workers have the capacity to focus on treating those who have more serious conditions,+ she said.  This is why the $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package announced last month had a strong focus on saving jobs and protecting workers, and any further boost will do likewise, as Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has said, she added.  Mrs Teo added: +This is a tough time. MOM is here to help. Our lines are sometimes overwhelmed, as are our officers. I seek your kind patience as we try our best to respond to everyone who has reached out.+  The MOM report, which is based on a survey of about 15,300 private and public sector organisations, said that the top industries with with high proportions of new positions among vacancies last year were construction, information and communications technology (ICT), and security and investigation.  Other sectors identified by the Government as growth sectors - professional services, financial and insurance services, wholesale trade and healthcare - also saw above average proportions of vacancies for newly created positions.  Among jobs for professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs), the most sought after workers last year were software, Web and multimedia developers; teaching and training professionals and systems analysts.  Related Story More job training support for four sectors hit hardest by Covid-19  Related Story Logistics and supply chain workers can tap new retraining programme for better job prospects  Related Story Fewer job vacancies last year as employers turned cautious: MOM  For non-PMET workers, the top number of openings were for security guards; receptionists, customer service and information clerks; and shop sales assistants.  Skilled workers were increasingly in demand, with the share of vacancies for PMETs rising to 58 per cent last year, up from 53 per cent the previous year.  The proportion has been on the rise since 2013, and MOM said this reflects a growing share of vacancies coming from industries dominated by PMETs, such as public administration and education, ICT, and health and social services.  For PMET vacancies, employers valued candidates+ skills, work experience, and attitude over academic qualifications for about half (46 per cent) of the vacancies.  +This underscores the need for job seekers to reskill and upskill to stay relevant to changing job requirements,+ said MOM in the report.  Mrs Teo also highlighted the jobs-skills mismatch in her post as a longer-term issue that still needs to be tackled.  While business is down, the Government wants to work with employers to reskill and upskill their workers to prepare them for new job opportunities when the economy recovers, she said.  +That may be a long way off, but it+s still a good way to make something out of a very bad situation.+  The lack of necessary specialised skills was the top challenge faced by employers trying to fill PMET vacancies, said MOM. It was cited by employers for four in 10 of the PMET vacancies they had trouble hiring locals for.  Related Story Job-search struggles of vulnerable PMETs aged over 40  Related Story Employment security among top concerns of job seekers: Poll  Other top reasons were candidates lacking necessary work experience, and finding the pay unattractive.  For non-PMET positions which were hard to fill with locals, the top three reasons were candidates finding the pay unattractive, finding the job physically strenuous, or preferring not to do shift work.  In general, PMET openings were easier to fill than non-PMET ones. Some 19 per cent of PMET vacancies were unfilled for at least six months, compared with 41 per cent of non-PMET vacancies.  The overall share of vacancies which remained unfilled for at least six months also fell to 28 per cent last year, the lowest in at least a decade.  National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay said in a Facebook post on Friday that there could still be job opportunities such as in sectors and firms affected by labour supply disruptions.  He said that NTUC is exploring ways to better match people who are unemployed or who have been placed on reduced work hours to such opportunities.  \u201cIt may require some of us to pick up some new skills or require us to make some difficult adjustments but we should hold fast and steady and tide through this difficult period together,\u201d he said.","28":"Q What is a quarantine order?  A A quarantine order is the strictest among the measures and is issued to those who are, or are suspected of being, a carrier of Covid-19.  This means the person has either been tested positive for the virus or has exhibited symptoms after returning from an affected country. They could also have come into close contact with a confirmed patient.  Quarantine usually occurs in the home, but can also be served in dedicated government quarantine facilities or hospitals.  Those under quarantine will be isolated from others, and should monitor their temperatures and report their health status to their quarantine order agent at least three times a day.  For those serving out orders at home, spot checks will be carried out by officers. If found to be non-compliant, they may be required to wear an electronic tag or be detained and isolated in a hospital.  Q What is the penalty for breaching a quarantine order?  A As it is a legal order issued under the Infectious Diseases Act, anyone flouting a quarantine for the first time may be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both, with higher penalties for subsequent breaches.  Q What is a stay-home notice?  A From 11.59pm today, this will apply to all Singapore residents returning to the country for 14 days.  People served the notice will not require a dedicated room and toilet, unlike those under quarantine orders, but they should remain in their place of residence at all times. This means they should not go out even to purchase daily necessities. They should also not invite visitors to their residence.  Their family members may continue to live with them. However, they should observe good personal hygiene practices. If those under a stay-home notice become unwell, they should avoid contact with family members and seek medical attention immediately.  Q What is the penalty for breaching a stay-home notice?  A Singaporeans who breach the notice can be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act. First-time offenders can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both.  Permanent residents and pass holders can have their permits or passes revoked or validity shortened. Students who breach their stay-home notices can also face disciplinary action, including suspension or dismissal.  Q What is leave of absence?  A People on this are advised to stay in their place of residence for 14 days but, unlike those on stay-home notices, can leave to purchase daily necessities or to attend to important personal matters.","29":"SINGAPORE - All regular worship services and gatherings in Anglican parish churches islandwide have been suspended until April 3.  The Anglican Diocese of Singapore said on Thursday (March 19) that this was with immediate effect to +create a two-week break in church gatherings+.  +The Diocesan leadership has closely monitored the escalating Covid-19 situation and makes this contribution towards the concerted national effort to +flatten the coronavirus curve+,+ it said, referring to the graph that shows a lower number of infected cases over time with proper containment measures.  There are currently 27 parishes of varying sizes in the Anglican Diocese of Singapore, with an average weekly attendance of about 21,000.  The churches plan to be open before the weekend of April 4 and 5, the start of Holy Week, which is the week leading up to Easter Sunday on April 12.  In the meantime, online weekend services will be conducted, and pastoral care will given to the elderly and the vulnerable.  The announcement comes after St Andrew+s Cathedral, the oldest Anglican site of worship in Singapore, was closed after one of its members was infected with the coronavirus.  On Wednesday, a notice was put up informing members that the church, located next to City Hall, would be closed from 11.59pm on Wednesday to 11.59pm on April 3 for the affected premises to be professionally disinfected.  It said that it received the information about the case on Wednesday afternoon, and the infected member is currently warded in hospital.  The man had attended the 9am English service held in the Cathedral New Sanctuary on Sunday.  +He had no symptoms of illness and passed the pre-service precautionary screening comprising the health and travel declaration and temperature checks,+ the cathedral+s Covid-19 management team said in the notice.  It also encouraged members to comply with the Ministry of Health (MOH) for contact tracing and seek verification from MOH on the authenticity of calls.  The authorities announced 32 new cases on Thursday, bringing the total number of infected patients here now to 345.  Of these, 159 are imported cases and the remaining 186 cases are locally transmitted cases.","30":"SINGAPORE - With the number of Covid-19 patients rising in the past week and going up by double digits in recent days, a carpark at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) will be used to screen patients for fever, to help alleviate the load.

It will be manned by staff from all six of the hospital+s medical divisions, as well as the nursing and allied health departments.  The move was announced on Thursday in an internal note to staff seen by The Straits Times and confirmed by an SGH spokesman.  Signed off by SGH chief executive officer Kenneth Kwek and medical board chairman Ruban Poopalalingam, the note said that the new screening area will help to manage the growing number of patients infected with the coronavirus nationally.  On Thursday, Singapore recorded 32 new cases. This was slightly lower than the 47 cases recorded the day before, the highest daily number since the start of the outbreak.  Singapore now has a total of 345 cases.  On Monday, the National Centre for Infectious Diseases saw unusually long queues, with people seeking Covid-19 testing without appointments or prior consultation at a clinic.  In the letter, Professor Kwek and Associate Professor Ruban said: +You would have read about the spike in the number of new Covid-19 cases in Singapore, setting a new high every day. This is a situation that we have anticipated and have been planning to meet the increased need for care.  +We are able to manage the surge because of all your efforts. Many of you have stretched yourselves physically, mentally, emotionally and psychologically and we are deeply grateful for everything you have done,+ they added.  As confirmed cases of Covid-19 exceed 200,000 around the world, hospitals have braced themselves for the surge.  Hospitals in Singapore have also been preparing for a rise in the number of cases, with Singapore seeing more imported cases in recent days.  Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said on Wednesday that the aim is to reduce the total number of cases on any day, so that the healthcare system can cope with the load.  At SGH, clinicians from other specialities have also joined in the effort to treat Covid-19 patients, lending their expertise to those in the Infectious Diseases and Emergency Medicine departments, said Profs Kwek and Ruban.

Here is what families should do when picking up anyone returning home, according to two infectious diseases experts.  PREPARATIONS  Dr Piotr Chlebicki, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Alvernia Hospital, said his daughter would be flying back on Friday from Sydney, where she is a student at the University of New South Wales.  He said it is important for parents to speak with their children before they board their flights to make sure they are asymptomatic.  +If they have symptoms like cough, fever or sore throat, they should not be flying. They should be considerate to other passengers,+ said Dr Chlebicki.  Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam said that people can be asymptomatic for two weeks, so anyone returning from abroad should be isolated for that duration.  Families must prepare a separate room, ideally with an attached bathroom, for the person, he said.  It would also be helpful to cordon off the area outside the person+s room, or any shared toilet, with tape, so that it would be a visual reminder, he added.  PICK-UP AT THE AIRPORT  Dr Leong, who practises at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said the person arriving should wear a mask and sit alone in the back seat of the car or taxi.  Windows should be down, and the air-conditioning in the vehicle switched off, he said.  The person should avoid any direct contact like hugging or kissing, and handle his own luggage.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  ARRIVAL AT HOME  Dr Leong said the person must go straight to his room once he reaches his home, and avoid touching any surfaces such as doorknobs or handles.  He should wipe down his luggage in his own room, either with water or disinfectant, he added.  +Clothes should be soaked in a pail of water for at least five to 10 minutes before being placed in a washing machine.+  INTERACTING WITH FAMILY  Dr Leong said: +The general rule is that he should keep a physical distance of more than 2m apart at all times.  +A family member needs to prepare food and water and place it outside his room, and he can come out and bring it into his room.+  However, Dr Chlebicki said that if the person is asymptomatic, the risk of getting infected by them is low, so there may not be a need for total separation.  The person can come out to get a drink of water, for example.  Related Story Coronavirus: How to quarantine yourself  +If they cough, they could generate a droplet (that could infect others). So, it is possible to be contagious before you display symptoms.  +But asymptomatic people are inefficient in transmitting the virus because they have a smaller amount of it, compared to symptomatic people. I think there should be a risk-benefit balance - the risk of getting the virus from an asymptomatic person is low and the benefit of having your child at home is high.+  But the person should still spend the bulk of the time in a separate room, he said, and family members should also observe basic hygiene such as frequent hand-washing.  Dr Leong said that if the person is using a shared bathroom, more precautions should be taken because the virus can be transmitted via surfaces. +He must wipe down what he touches before and after use, and close the (toilet) lid when flushing. The family members must also do the same.+  Similarly, all +high-touch+ areas in the home, such as door handles, doorknobs, taps and sinks must be cleaned frequently, he added.

According to the Ministry of Health+s website, people who have recently travelled overseas, and are feeling unwell with a fever or respiratory symptoms like a cough or runny nose, should go to any of the Public Health Preparedness Clinics, or polyclinics to seek medical attention promptly.  +The risk of picking up Covid-19 for people who have travelled is really much higher than the general population,+ he added.","33":"SINGAPORE - Singapore has managed to ramp up its import of eggs from other countries following Malaysia+s lockdown on Wednesday (March 18), Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Thursday.  About 73 per cent of Singapore+s eggs are from Malaysia, according to last published official figures from 2018, and Malaysia+s latest Covid-19 movement restriction order has left some worried about Singapore+s egg supply.  But Mr Chan reiterated on Facebook that +we also have many other source countries which we have identified over the years and are able activate them quickly when the need calls for it+.  +This applies not just to eggs but other food products and essential items... These efforts to secure and diversify our food supply have been developed and strengthened through the years,+ he said.  The minister was at Changi Airport on Thursday to receive \u201cvery special cargo\u201d - 300,000 eggs from Thailand.  Singapore also imports eggs from accredited farms in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. About a quarter of all eggs Singaporeans consume daily are produced locally.  The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said on Wednesday that Singapore+s food supply has not been disrupted by Malaysia+s two-week lockdown.  Mr Chan added in his latest Facebook post: +Even though we have a robust plan in place, we do not take it for granted and reassess it regularly to test its robustness against different scenarios.  +This is how things have always been done in Singapore and will continue to guide our approach to all issues, big and small, going forward.+  He thanked the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, the SFA , Singapore Airlines and Changi Airport+s main airline caterer Sats for their quick response in facilitating the larger import of eggs.

Among them, 33 were imported and 30 involved Singapore residents returning from abroad. This brought the total number of cases here to 313.  In light of these recent developments, it is vital that people mind their health, and take the necessary precautions should they feel unwell.  Q: What are the symptoms for Covid-19?  The two most common symptoms for Covid-19 are fever (of 37.8 deg C and above) and cough.  Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam said that those who are experiencing either of the two symptoms, or both, should consult a doctor.  He also added that those who feel generally unwell should also see a doctor, noting that practically all the identified Covid-19 cases had the sensation of being unwell at some point.  Q: What about mild, flu-like symptoms which are not fever and cough? Should I visit the doctor as well?  Other mild, flu-like symptoms such as sore throat, stuffy nose and runny nose should be monitored closely for at least five days, said Dr Leong, as sore throat and stuffy nose were not symptoms present in 90 per cent of the confirmed Covid-19 cases.  However, people should look out for any prolonged or worsening symptoms, as well as new, developing symptoms, he noted, and see a doctor if these occur.  In the meantime, individuals should practise self-quarantine measures at home and avoid going out, as there is a chance they could be incubating the virus.  Q: Can I self-medicate at home if I+m facing any of the above symptoms?  You may self-medicate if you are facing mild symptoms. However, you should visit a doctor if the symptoms are prolonged or worsening.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  If you are having a cough or fever, which are common Covid-19 symptoms, you should definitely visit a doctor.  On whether people suffering from Covid-19 symptoms should avoid taking ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug meant for fever and pain, Dr Leong said that it has not yet been clinically proven that the drug predisposes the body to more infections.  But he suggests they choose alternatives such as paracetamol, synflex or voltaren as a precautionary measure.  Q: Should I visit the doctor if I+m experiencing breathlessness?  Yes, although breathlessness does not usually develop until the later stages of Covid-19. By then, individuals would have experienced other accompanying symptoms as well, noted Dr Leong.  Dr Piotr Chlebicki, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Alvernia Hospital, also shared the same advice, adding that breathlessness is cause for medical attention, as the individual could be facing other complications like heart disease or asthma.  Q: What if I am asymptomatic so far, but I don+t feel very well in general, should I still see the doctor?  Yes, as long as you are feeling unwell, or sense that something is out of the ordinary, it would be a good idea to visit the doctor.  Dr Chlebicki also suggested that it would be good practice to call in to clinics before going, as this could help reduce overcrowding.  In addition, you should also refrain from doctor-hopping, said MOH in an advisory on March 11, as going back to the same doctor could ensure follow-up, and that you+re sent for Covid-19 testing if necessary.","36":"SINGAPORE - The Republic has confirmed 32 new coronavirus patients, including 24 imported cases, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Thursday (March 19).  This is a drop from the 47 new cases that were recorded on Wednesday, the highest number since the start of the outbreak.  All of the imported cases were returning residents and long-term pass holders, with the bulk having travelled to Europe - currently the epicentre of the virus. Most patients who visited Europe were in Britain \u2013 13 patients \u2013 while the others had visited countries like Switzerland and France.  As for the other imported cases, they had visited other countries such as the United States and parts of Asia like Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines.  The remaining eight patients were locally transmitted cases, with two linked to previous cases including one from a sub-cluster linked to the Boulder+ Gym at 12 Kallang Avenue. Boulder+ Gym is a sub-cluster of a cluster linked to a private dinner event at Safra Jurong.  The other six local cases are not linked to previous cases.  With 32 new cases on Thursday, the total number of infected patients here now stands at 345. Of these, 159 are imported cases and the remaining 186 cases are locally transmitted cases.  This means close to one in two patients in Singapore are imported cases who got the coronavirus from overseas.  Seven more patients have been discharged from hospital, bringing the total number of patients who have fully recovered to 124.  Of the 221 patients still in hospital, 15 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.  As of Thursday 12pm, MOH said it has identified 6,574 close contacts who have been quarantined.  Of these, 2,273 are currently quarantined, and 4,301 have completed their quarantine.","37":"SINGAPORE - New developments for the Covid-19 situation have been coming thick and fast over the past few days, with Malaysia deciding to impose a lockdown and fresh travel restrictions being put in place by Singapore. Reporter Lester Wong explains what these developments mean for Singaporeans.  Q: What does the Malaysian lockdown involve?  A: Malaysia+s two-week lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus kicked in on Wednesday (March 18) and will run until March 31. During this period, Malaysian citizens are barred from travelling overseas and foreign visitors will not be allowed into the country.  Public gatherings are banned, along with all religious, sporting, social and cultural events. Schools, universities and non-essential businesses remain closed.  Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said on Monday that essential services such as food supply, banking, healthcare, transport and security will continue to operate.  Grocery stores, supermarkets and pharmacies have also stayed open.  Malaysia has shut its side of the Causeway and Second Link, although some exemptions have been made.  Q: Can Singaporeans residing in Malaysia come back to Singapore?  A: Yes. The Malaysian lockdown only applies to Malaysian citizens. However, those who return to Singapore after 11.59pm on Friday will have to serve 14 days of self-isolation.  Q: Are there any exemptions that can continue to travel between Singapore and Malaysia?  A: Yes. Delivery workers on the many trucks making trips across the Causeway with supplies of fresh food, pharmaceuticals and infant diapers are allowed through the checkpoints.  +You can+t expect them to drive through and then tell them to stay at home for 14 days,+ National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said on Wednesday, referring to the delivery drivers.

A district court heard that the man even lied to the minor, claiming that he reciprocated her feelings even though he felt no romantic attachment to her.  Deputy Public Prosecutor Ho Jiayun said: +Ultimately, he took advantage of her youthful affection for him... and saw her merely as a means to satisfy his own sexual desire.+  On Thursday (March 19), the 33-year-old man was sentenced to three years and seven months+ jail after pleading guilty to two counts of sexually penetrating a minor.  He also admitted to one count of sexually exploiting a child. Four other similar charges involving the same girl were considered during sentencing.  Due to a gag order, details of the offender and the school cannot be revealed to protect the victim+s identity.  The court heard that he had been one of the girl+s teachers since she was a Secondary 1 student in 2017.  The following year, the pair started exchanging text messages and initially chatted about school work.  But over time, they started discussing personal issues and became closer.

The girl later told her teacher that she +liked+ him. He lied, claiming he felt the same way.  When school ended at around 2pm on Feb 15 last year, the man took the girl back to his flat and asked her to perform oral sex on him.  The minor did as she was told and he later drove her back to school so that her mother could pick her up.  During the school holidays on March 17 last year, the man conspired with the girl to lie to her mother, claiming that she had to attend a remedial class the next day.  He picked her up from her mother+s workplace at around 10am the next day, and they went to his flat where he performed oral sex on the girl. He also sexually penetrated her.  His offences came to light on April 4 last year when the girl+s father noticed that she was using an iPhone 6.  When the father asked her about the phone, he was told it was a gift from the teacher.  A check on the phone also uncovered messages suggesting a romantic relationship between the pair.  The father alerted the school principal, who lodged a police report two days later.  Urging the court to sentence the offender to more than four years+ jail, DPP Ho told District Judge Christopher Goh that the girl had trusted the teacher to nurture and educate her.  The DPP added: +He abused this trust by sexually exploiting the victim and leading her down the path of moral corruption.+  For each count of sexually penetrating a minor, the man could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined.  The Ministry of Education (MOE) said in response to queries by The Straits Times that it was unable to take internal disciplinary action against the man as police investigations were ongoing at the time of the case and he had also resigned from the teaching service in April last year before he was charged with any offences.  MOE added that teachers must always conduct themselves in a manner which upholds the integrity of the profession and the trust placed in them.  MOE will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against those who fail to adhere to its standards of conduct and discipline, including dismissal from service.

In a post on the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) Facebook page on Thursday (March 19), Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir said that Muslims here should +play (their) part+ and not attend such gatherings, which have caused widespread infection of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  +I hear that some foreign religious organisers say that they fear God more than viruses and therefore, they continue with gatherings,+ said Dr Nazirudin.  +This is not the time to be senseless and irresponsible. I would like to be absolutely clear.+  From Feb 27 to March 1, more than 16,000 devotees had gathered at the Masjid Jamek Sri Petaling in Kuala Lumpur.  This gathering, believed to be for followers of the Tablighi Jama+at, a Muslim missionary movement, has since turned into a large cluster after hundreds of its attendees were infected with the Covid-19 virus.  At least five Singaporeans who returned here from this gathering have tested positive for Covid-19.  So far, 101 Singaporeans have been identified as having attended the gathering in Malaysia.  Mosques islandwide are currently closed for two weeks to prevent the coronavirus from spreading any further in religious institutions here.

Speaking to reporters at a press conference at the Prime Minister+s office, Mr Ismail noted the +worrying+ predicament of these workers whose livelihoods were affected when Malaysia closed its border for a fortnight as part of its Restricted Movement Order (RMO).  Some 300,000 Malaysians work in Singapore. About a half of them are believed to be daily commuters.  +We are negotiating and we have suggested that the 300,000 are allowed to continue working in Singapore on condition Singapore prepares lodgings for them,+ said Datuk Seri Ismail, who is also the defence minister. +This matter is under discussion.

But despite being warned not to cheat, a significant number allegedly shared their answers and plagiarised one another.  NUS is now scrutinising their submissions and identifying the alleged cheaters so action can be taken against them.  Replying to queries from The New Paper, a spokesman for the NUS School of Computing confirmed it is investigating, with instructors still making plagiarism checks and have yet to finalise the results.  +NUS takes a serious view of academic dishonesty and does not condone plagiarism,+ she said.  TNP understands Mr Prabawa Adi Yoga Sidi, the lecturer teaching the module, sent out an e-mail about a week ago urging students who had cheated to confess.  It is believed that several have come forward and admitted to plagiarism.  The exam is worth 15 per cent of the final grade for the programming methodology module, which is compulsory for engineering students.  The module, also known as CS1010E, is described as an introduction to fundamental concepts of problem solving, involving the use of computing and programming in the Python programming language.  The spokesman said about 680 students are taking the module in the current semester.  CLASS SETTING  The exam is usually held in a class setting, but in light of Covid-19, Mr Prabawa allowed it to be taken at home earlier this month.  Related Story NUS reminds students to declare travel plans after foreign exchange student expelled  Students had to log in at the same time to work independently on three tasks, comprising seven questions, and submit their answers online.  The spokesman said students were reminded that there would be plagiarism checks and penalties if they were caught.  According to NUS policies, students who plagiarise or aid and abet such actions may be subject to disciplinary action.  +In addition, the student may receive a reduced grade, possibly even a zero mark, for the relevant academic assignment, project or thesis, and could receive a failed grade for the module,+ said the spokesman.  +Any student caught plagiarising will be required to retain the plagiarised module as graded.+  Numerous posts on Facebook page NUSWhispers in the past week claimed to be from students taking the module.  Some claimed they had cheated because the conditions were difficult and it was to be expected, while others said they had learnt their lesson.  One post, addressed to Mr Prabawa, claimed that if disciplinary action was taken, it would be the school+s fault that +almost half+ of the students would be severely affected and face problems with graduation and finding jobs.  Another post said students were +begging for mercy+, as the plagiarism checks are +almost a death sentence+.  Related Story Interactive: How coronavirus is spreading across the world  Commenting on one of the posts, Mr Prabawa said the instructors were able to measure similarities in submissions and identify possible collaborations within groups, and this will be investigated further.  +Plagiarism is not a victimless crime.

The spokesman said: +The school is aware of the diverse views raised by students.+  She said that instructors will address their concerns and plan to conduct optional remedial sessions to help those who had difficulties with the module.","42":"SINGAPORE - A recession in Singapore +appears inevitable+, said DBS Bank as it now sees the economy shrinking by 0.5 per cent this year, instead of the 0.9 per cent growth it forecast last month.  This downgraded forecast still comes with significant downside risks should the coronavirus outbreak worsen further, DBS economist Irvin Seah said in a research note on Thursday (March 19).  He also expects total retrenchments for the year to reach about 24,500, slightly above the 23,430 in 2009 during the Global Financial Crisis.  +Considering the chaotic situation in many parts of the world and the economic costs of those restrictive measures on trade, investment, consumption and travel, this is evolving into a +self-induced+ global recession. Being a small and open economy, Singapore will not be spared,+ he said.  Mr Seah said a second stimulus package of up to $14 billion to $16 billion could be rolled out, funded by the remaining Budget surplus for this term of Government of about $7.7 billion and an additional $6 billion to $8 billion from the reserves.  A $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package was announced during the Budget statement last month.  He also expects the Monetary Authority of Singapore to take a more aggressive monetary response amid falling inflation and the significant downside risk to growth.  +Specifically, we expect MAS to end the modest and gradual appreciation path of the SGD NEER (nominal effective exchange rate) policy band, and introduce a downward re-centring of the band by up to 2 per cent. In fact, an announcement before the next scheduled policy meeting around mid-April should not come as a surprise, given the urgency of the matter,+ he said.  Mr Seah said he expects year-on-year contractions of up to 2 percentage points for the first two quarters of the year - which would be a technical recession - and a contraction in the third quarter before an improvement at the end of the year.  He noted that this comes after the bank revised Singapore+s gross domestic product growth forecast down to 0.9 per cent on Feb 7. But back then, the Covid-19 outbreak was still largely contained within China, with only pockets of infection elsewhere.  The situation has deteriorated sharply since then, with the number of infections in other parts of the world multiplying by more than 400 times, he said.  Also, travel restrictions imposed by Singapore have been broadened beyond China to cover markets accounting for about 69 per cent of Singapore+s total tourist arrivals last year, he said.  These include South Korea, Britain, Japan, France and Asean countries.  Related Story Deeper wage offsets, foreign worker levy waivers on wish list  Related Story MAS says it stands ready to ensure the stability of Singapore+s financial system amid coronavirus spread  As such, the services sector - particular tourism-related industries such as hotels and restaurants, aviation, point-to-point transport services, retail and entertainments services will be severely impacted.  A sharp contraction in global demand would also put a dent on the near-term prospects for Singapore+s exports and the manufacturing sector, said Mr Seah, adding that global economic activity will slow significantly, as governments around the world have introduced city- and country-wide lockdowns and border closures, and companies have put in place business continuity plans.  He said that Singapore+s downturn this year will be a lot deeper than that during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, and more painful than the Global Financial Crisis in 2009.  In these two downturns, Singapore still managed to post GDP growth of 4.5 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively, he said.  He noted that the previous occasions when Singapore saw full year contractions were during the Dot.com Bust in 2001 (-1.1 per cent), the Asian Financial Crisis in 1999 (-2.2 per cent) and the manufacturing recession in 1985 (-0.6 per cent).  For the second government support package, Mr Seah proposed the following measures:  \u2022 Broaden the temporary bridging loan scheme to include all industries;  \u2022 Increase the quantum of the temporary bridging loan scheme to up to $2 million, up from $1 million;  \u2022 Increase the quantum of the working capital loan scheme to up to $1 million, up from $600,000;  \u2022 Raise wage subsidy under the Jobs Support Scheme to 12 per cent for all Singaporean workers, up from 8 per cent, with the grant covering six months instead of three;  \u2022 Disburse a one-off cash grant to micro and small enterprises immediately; and,  \u2022 Waive for one month the foreign worker levy for workers affected by measures introduced to counter the spread of Covid-19.  He also hopes to see more help for workers at risk of losing their jobs, such as deferment of personal income tax payments for all retrenched workers, a one-off retrenchment benefit for those displaced, and tax deductions for profitable companies to hire retrenched workers.  Other economists are still expecting the economy to grow over the year, for now.  OCBC Bank chief economist Selena Ling said the bank\u2019s latest forecast for Singapore\u2019s full year GDP growth is 0.3 per cent.  She added that this will be reassessed based on GDP growth data for the first quarter of this year, which will be released next month, the upcoming second fiscal stimulus package, MAS\u2019 expected monetary policy easing, and whether Malaysia will extend its Movement Control Order beyond March 31.  United Overseas Bank\u2019s growth forecast for this year is 0.5 per cent, though there are further downside risks, said the bank\u2019s economist Barnabas Gan.  He said that the estimates also assume a potential technical recession in the first half of the year.  \u201cAccounting for the direct negative effects on Singapore\u2019s tourism industry as well as secondary effects on Asia\u2019s supply chain and external environment, we perceive Singapore\u2019s output gap to stay negative for the whole of 2020,\u201d he said, meaning that the Republic\u2019s economy is expected to perform below its potential.","43":"SINGAPORE - St Andrew+s Cathedral, the oldest Anglican site of worship in Singapore, has been closed after one of its members was infected with the coronavirus.

The outbreak would have hit its peak by July, after which the number of infections here would start going down, said Associate Professor Alexander Cook, vice-dean for research at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.","46":"SINGAPORE - Singaporeans and residents returning to the country will all have to serve a 14-day stay-home notice (SHN), the authorities said on Wednesday (March 18), as Singapore reported 47 new Covid-19 cases, an all-time high.  The move, which will take effect from 11.59pm on Friday (March 20), was among new measures announced to contain the spread of coronavirus cases. To date, Singapore has reported a total of 313 cases.  Here+s what you need to know about SHN, based on the Ministry of Health advisory:  1. Am I under quarantine orders if I am on SHN?  No, you are not under quarantine orders and are not required to have a dedicated room and toilet if this is not feasible. However, you should remain in your place of residence at all times during the 14-day period.  2. What is the difference between leave of absence and SHN?  People taking leave of absence are allowed to leave their place of residence to purchase daily necessities or to attend to important personal matters.  Those issued a SHN should remain in their place of residence at all times during the 14-day period.  3. Can my family members continue to stay with me during this time? Are they at risk of infection?  Your family members may continue to live with you. However, you and your family should observe good personal hygiene practices. If you become unwell, avoid contact with your family members and seek medical attention immediately.  4. My family members\/flatmates\/tenants have just returned from one of the affected areas. Can I still carry on with my daily activities, such as going to work or school?  Yes, the SHN applies only to persons returning from affected areas listed in the advisory (NOTE: From Friday, March 20, at 11.59pm, the SHN will be extended to all people arriving from overseas). Nonetheless, you should continue to monitor your health, observe good personal hygiene and seek medical attention if unwell.  5. Do I need to declare to my employers\/schools that I am on SHN?  Those who have returned from the affected areas are advised to inform their employers or schools that they are on SHN. This is so that your employer or school can provide the necessary assistance to facilitate your SHN.  6. If I am delivering food\/supplies to a person under SHN, should I wear a mask or other protective equipment to protect myself?  There is no need for masks or other protective equipment. The delivery can be conducted in such a way as to minimise contact with the person under SHN. The SHN is a precautionary measure and persons under SHN are not close contacts of confirmed cases.  7. Can I send my employees\/students to the doctor to get tested at the end of the 14-day period so that they can be cleared to come back to work\/return to school?  It is not useful to send persons who do not have symptoms to the doctor\/hospital for testing. Such individuals will not be offered diagnostic testing, and will be asked to return home.  8. What if I do not comply with the SHN?  If you fail to comply with the SHN, you may face the following penalties, as you have put the well-being of the wider community at risk:  a. You may be prosecuted under Section 21A of the Infectious Diseases Act.  b. If you are a Singapore permanent resident, long-term-visit pass holder, dependant+s pass holder, or student+s pass holder, your re-entry permit or passes may be revoked or the validity shortened.  c.

For foreign students, this may include the cancellation of your child+s\/ward+s student+s pass or dependant+s pass.  9. What if I require medical attention while on SHN?  For life-threatening cases such as cardiac arrest, active seizures, breathlessness, major traumas and stroke, please call 995 directly for assistance.  For non-emergencies (such as cough or fever, follow-up visits for chronic conditions, refilling of prescription, etc):  a. For Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders, you may contact the People+s Association (PA) at 6344-8222. PA will assist you to make the necessary arrangements with the nearest Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC) or GP clinic, or to arrange for a house call by a GP (for those with mobility issues).  Please inform the staff and doctor of your travel history and that you have been issued an SHN.  b. For students\/pre-school students, you can seek assistance from your school or MOE\/ECDA.  c. For foreign employees issued with a work pass, you should contact your employer.  10.

Non-Covid patients could also be transferred to private hospitals to free up capacity at public hospitals, he said.  +There are various plans for us to expand the capacity. Today I visited Tan Tock Seng Hospital and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. They have contingency plans to turn normal wards into isolation wards,+ Mr Gan said.  There are also plans +to convert some of our quarantine facilities for the less severe cases, including those recovering from Covid 19. We just want to make sure they are safe+, he said.  Singapore announced 47 new cases on Wednesday, an record single-day high here that brings the total number of cases to 313.  Mr Gan outlined the plans when asked, during a press conference, if Singapore+s healthcare system was close to hitting the limit of its capacity.  The co-chair of a government task force to fight the coronavirus, Mr Gan said that Singapore still had sufficient buffer to cope with the increase in the number of new patients.  He emphasised that any adjustments made to Singapore+s strategy to deal with the virus would have to be progressive and gradual.  He said: +We have a few options. Currently, close to 80 per cent of the cases we see that do not need much support or medical attention are kept in hospitals for various reasons such as for isolation purposes... the bulk of these can be housed elsewhere.+  +One possibility is to look at some long-term care facilities that come with sufficient safeguards because they are medical facilities, or converting quarantine facilities that can provide minimal medical care, including swabs and some attention to medical needs,+ Mr Gan said.  He added that arrangements can be made to move patients back to hospitals nearby if their conditions worsen.  Mr Gan said there is also collaboration with private hospitals +to see if we can send some non-Covid patients to them+.  He added: +We already have ongoing collaborations. Some of these can be stepped up so that we can preserve capacity in our public hospitals. Some private hospitals also are equipped to handle Covid patients....We must underline emphasis on one healthcare system.+  Even as various options are being considered, Singapore must not be complacent, the Health Minister stressed.  Mr Gan said: +I still need to emphasise that although we have a buffer and there are plans to expand this buffer, we must do all we can to reduce the number of new cases and flatten the curve.+","48":"SINGAPORE - Singaporeans and residents returning to the country will all have to serve a 14-day isolation period, while people in the country should defer all travel overseas, the authorities announced on Wednesday (March 18), as the country saw 47 new cases, an all-time high.  This brings the total number of cases to 313.  In line with recent trends, 33 of the new cases are imported and 30 of them involve Singapore residents returning from abroad.  The new, broader measures to contain the coronavirus come as the country braces itself for more to come.  As more Singaporeans, such as students and workers, return home, the country has to be mentally prepared that numbers could remain high in the coming days, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force set up to deal with the outbreak.  The rise in number of infected cases on Wednesday and in recent days was a cause of concern for all, he noted during a press conference on Wednesday.  \u201cWe cannot afford to take further risks if the number of imported cases continue to rise. That is why we\u2019re imposing additional border controls and travel restrictions today.\u201d  So for outgoing residents, the advisory had been raised from stopping non-essential travel to defer all travel.  As for those returning, he added: +This means a Singaporean coming back from anywhere in the world will have to serve a full 14-day self-isolation period.  The extension of the stay-home notice to all people arriving will take effect on Friday at 11.59pm.  New measures are being planned for social distancing among people, especially among seniors and vulnerable people in the community, to further reduce risk of local transmission.  The number of new cases daily in Singapore has been on an uptick with 14, 17 and 23 cases on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday respectively, all of which were new daily highs.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Task force co-chair and Health Minister Gan Kim Yong noted that measures put in place such as physical distancing and social measures are aimed at reducing the peak case number, and spreading things out.  This is so that the health system has sufficient capacity for the cases, and to preserve as much buffer capacity as possible, he explained.  +By deferring the peak, it also means that the outbreak might last longer and instead of everyone coming down with Covid-19, we will have to stretch it out.  +We have to be prepared for that,+ he said.  He added: +It+s important to bear in mind that (while) we have planned for it, we must never be complacent and take it for granted.  +We must do all we can and aim to reduce the total number of cases so that our healthcare system can still manage them.+  LISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST","49":"SINGAPORE - Food supply to Singapore and prices of fresh groceries have not been affected by Malaysia+s lockdown that started on Wednesday (March 18), a key move by the country to stem the spread of the coronavirus.

The police said in a statement on Wednesday that they received a report that a male victim was on the ground floor of the shopping mall in Victoria Street when spittle falling from a higher floor of the mall landed on him.  Preliminary investigations showed that the three boys had spat over the railing from the fifth floor of the mall last Thursday, some time after 5pm.  With the help of police cameras, officers from the Central Police Division established the identities of the boys.  The teenagers are being investigated by the police for being a public nuisance.  The police said that the incident caused alarm and annoyance,in the light of the coronavirus outbreak, since infections can spread indirectly through contaminated surfaces.  The arrests come in the wake of similar incidents also involving teenagers.  Last Thursday, three other teenagers, two boys and one girl aged between 17 and 19, were arrested over a suspected spitting incident in a shopping mall in central Singapore.

Malaysians are the only nationality, apart from Singaporeans and permanent residents, who can work here as licensed security officers.  Firms here have scrambled to persuade their Malaysian employees, most of whom commute daily across the Causeway for work, to stay - and to secure accommodation for them.  President of the Security Association Singapore Raj Joshua Thomas estimates that about 10,000 to 15,000 security officers are Malaysians, who will be cut off from Singapore by the travel ban. This makes up about one-third of the security officer workforce here, he estimated.  Malaysia announced on Monday night (March 16) that it is imposing a movement control order prohibiting Malaysians from leaving the country, as well as foreigners from entering. It will come into force at midnight on Wednesday (March 18).  Since the announcement, security firms have rushed to make arrangements for their Malaysian workforce.  Mr Robert Wiener, president of the Association of Certified Security Agencies, said firms have sent their workers home early to pack their bags and return to Singapore ahead of the midnight deadline.  Businesses are following the Ministry of Manpower+s recommendations to house workers with relatives, friends or colleagues, or in commercial properties like dormitories and hotels.  However, Mr Thomas said firms hope the rules can be relaxed to allow workers to temporarily stay in office premises with reasonable conditions. There are strict rules governing the housing of foreign employees, aimed at preventing employers from housing their employees in illegal dormitories.  +We are looking at around $25 to $30 to house a person in a dormitory, and this is high cost - it can be more than what the agency can earn per day, per officer. It doesn+t make (fiscal) sense to put them up there,+ said Mr Thomas.

Almost all commute across the border daily for work, and about two in three said they will take up the company+s offer of accommodation in hostels or hotels, he added.  Other companies report that their Malaysian employees are also keen on staying on.  A Certis spokesman said that less than five per cent of its total workforce decided to remain in Malaysia.  The integrated security services firm is also arranging temporary lodging for affected workers, and will provide some basic necessities and laundry services.  But firms are wary that there will still be a shortfall in manpower despite their best efforts.  Mr Thomas said it is +inevitable+ that there will be manpower shortages, and security agencies will need to streamline operations to meet security outcomes.  The firms can look at measures such as reducing patrol points to just critical ones, or even to limit the number of entry points in a building to help security officers in screening, he said.

Among other things, all Malaysians will be barred from travelling abroad and there will also be a ban on all foreign tourists and visitors to the country.  The Government has given assurances that all Malaysian workers who choose to remain in Singapore will have a place to stay, and that it is providing financial help to employers.  About 100,000 Malaysians working here have no living arrangements in Singapore. They include some 1,000 nurses and other healthcare workers who make the daily commute from across the causeway to their workplaces here.  +In the few hours that we+ve been (working with them), we+ve been able to match more than 10,000 so far in the few short hours we had, so we+re confident that those affected will be able to find suitable accommodation by the end of the night,+ said Minister Josephine Teo on Tuesday, speaking at a press conference held by the multi-ministry task force on the Covid-19 virus.  +It may take some time because employers and workers have preferences, and different budgets, so we need time to match them,+ she said.  About 415,000 people, many of them Malaysians working in Singapore, use the land checkpoints between the two countries daily.  Employers have mostly been able to find accommodation options on their own, but those who have had difficulty doing so - numbering around several hundred - have approached the Ministry of Manpower, Mrs Teo added.

A third option is rental, with the authorities rolling out a plan to help with costs, to the tune of $50 per worker, per night for 14 nights.  +Our objective is to minimise any impact on the delivery of services for our people,+ MOM said.  +We advise employers to assess their manpower needs carefully and make a considered decision as to whether they need their affected workers to remain in Singapore,+ said MOM.  +In providing assistance, we will prioritise the needs of firms that provide essential services such as healthcare, security, cleaning, waste management, facilities management, logistics and transport.+","60":"SINGAPORE - Malaysian staff who commute daily to Singapore will either be housed in guest rooms or be asked to take leave, say hotels affected by the country+s movement restriction order.

Malaysians, including those who commute to work daily from across the Causeway, will be barred from overseas travel.  Grand Park City Hall general manager Jeane Lim said about 10 per cent of Malaysian staff, who work in roles such as housekeeping, kitchen staff and front of house, commute across the border daily.  She added that the hotel will provide free accommodation in guest rooms for these employees. As of this afternoon, three of them have accepted the offer.  Singapore hotelier Far East Hospitality, which includes properties such as Oasia Hotel Downtown and The Barracks Hotel Sentosa, will also offer accommodation to Malaysian staff who are +critical to the operations in our properties+, said chief executive Arthur Kiong.  Those who remain in Malaysia will use their annual leave. The company will supplement it with paid leave thereafter.  About 20 per cent of the group+s staff are Malaysians, with most of them working in housekeeping and banquet operations.  +Despite the last-minute surge in demand for accommodation by companies affected by the lockdown, current business volumes are still below pre-Covid-19 level.

All services will be suspended for an initial period of three weeks, from March 23 to at least April 15, the airline told The Straits Times.  This is a result of new government restrictions across multiple jurisdictions in recent days and subsequent unprecedented falls in travel demand, a spokesman said.  +The decision reflects responses beyond our control including a rapid decline in forward travel demand due to government containment measures, corporate travel bans and a general pullback from everyday activities across the community,+ she added.  Jetstar Asia is containing the impact as much as possible by asking staff to take paid and unpaid leave during this time, in addition to cancelling annual bonuses and the Annual Wage Supplement payment, she further said.  The airline has about 800 employees, including 500 pilots and cabin crew.  Customers impacted by the suspension will be offered a full refund in the form of a travel credit voucher.  The fastest and easiest way for customers to request a voucher is by visiting the Manage My Booking section via the website, the airline said.  Jetstar said customers should not call the contact centre as it is expecting long call wait times due to high demand.  Jetstar Asia is Singapore-owned but part of Australia+s Qantas group.

Malaysia had announced that its citizens would not be allowed to travel overseas for two weeks starting from Wednesday (March 18), as part of a slew of measures to arrest the spread of the coronavirus.  All schools, universities, and businesses there would be shut, and all public gatherings banned during this period, although essential services would continue, Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin had said.  Mr Wong said that if the multiple lines of defences that the Government has put in place - such as border controls, contact tracing, and social distancing - can be tightened, then Singapore need not reach a situation where the entire city has to be locked down.  +We could potentially do, for example... a major circuit breaker that doesn+t entail a lockdown, but entails school closures, workplace closures, and doing it on a temporary basis over a period of two to three weeks, just as the Malaysians have done.+  +So there is a whole range of measures that we have in our toolkit, and we constantly monitor the environment, the risk situation, and then we will adjust our measures,+ he added.  At the press conference, also attended by Manpower Minister Josephine Teo and Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, the authorities said it was helping companies which employ Malaysian workers, especially those that provide essential services, to find temporary accommodation in Singapore.  Mr Wong said that the land crossing with Malaysia is something that needed special consideration given the high volume of people and goods passing through.  +That+s why we+ve been discussing this matter bilaterally, but in recent days, the Malaysians, seeing the seriousness of the matter within their own country... decided that they needed a swift and urgent response.+  He said that if and when these measures are lifted by Malaysia, things cannot go back to +business as usual+.

He was deported from Thailand in January 2018, but was detained in London, at Singapore+s request, while en route to Canada.  The Thai government had rejected Singapore+s request to extradite Roach, as the two countries have no extradition treaty in place.  The successful extradition from Britain marks the end of a lengthy process to have Roach return to Singapore+s shores.  Singapore had to reassure the British government that he would not be caned if he were to be convicted of robbery, which is an offence that comes with mandatory caning here.  British laws prohibit the authorities from extraditing Roach without such an undertaking. The country had abolished caning for criminals in 1948.  Roach appealed multiple times to the British High Court to reverse the decision to extradite him to Singapore, said the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Attorney General+s Chambers (AGC) in a joint statement.  The High Court heard and dismissed his appeal, and Roach was handed over to the Singapore Police Force+s custody on March 16.

Employers of Malaysian workers who need to put up their staff in temporary accommodation can also get help from government agencies and trade associations, he said in a doorstop interview on Tuesday.  He gave the assurances following concerns among Singaporeans over the implications of Malaysia+s announcement on Monday that it will restrict all movement throughout the country from Wednesday until March 31, to prevent further spread of the coronavirus within the country.  All Malaysians will be barred from travelling abroad. For those who are returning from overseas, they must undergo a health inspection and undergo self-quarantine for 14 days.  There will also be a ban on all foreign tourists and visitors.  About 415,000 travellers use the land checkpoints between Singapore and Malaysia daily, with these usually increasing during festive seasons.  Mr Chan on Tuesday said that although not all details with Malaysia have been worked out, Singaporeans have no cause for worry as Singapore has plans to manage the situation with a combination of stockpiling, local production and diversification of overseas sources.  He said these various channels will give Singapore time to source for and bring in alternative supplies. He also noted that a restriction of human movement need not necessarily mean a disruption of the movement of goods.  He added: +For carbohydrates, like rice and noodles, we have more than three months+ worth of stockpile at the national level... For both proteins and vegetables, we have more than two months+ worth of normal consumption.  +For eggs, we have local production and we have activated other air freight options to substitute the Malaysian supplies should they be disrupted.+  He said he cannot reveal the actual numbers as it will affect Singapore+s negotiations with overseas suppliers.  On Monday night, there were queues at various supermarkets hereafter Malaysia+s announcement, with shoppers snapping up food products and daily necessities.  On the accommodation for Malaysian workers, Mr Chan noted that many employers have been worried since Monday night on how to provide short-term housing for their Malaysian workers in Singapore without living arrangements here, which is estimated to number more than 100,000.  +During this period, our economic agencies are working with the companies+ dormitory operators and hotels to provide options for the companies. So, companies that need help for their workers accommodation can contact economic agencies, and also work with their trade associations,+ he said.  National Trade Union Congress secretary-general Ng Chee Meng on Tuesday also urged shoppers to remain calm.  He said he is keeping close tabs on the situation with NTUC FairPrice chief executive officer Seah Kian Peng.  He wrote on Facebook: +Buy only what you need please, otherwise we may see some empty shelves again and this in turn will cause unnecessary panic buying.+  Mr Chan said he understood the fear and anxiety of Singaporeans and urged Singaporeans who are calm to reach out to those who are nervous.  +While we may be anxious individually, we can also draw strength as a community, and we must remember to reach out to the weaker and more vulnerable ones in our society.+","76":"SINGAPORE - Singapore+s non-oil domestic exports (Nodx) grew by 3 per cent in February year on year, beating economists+ expectations of another drop amid the coronavirus crisis.  Analysts polled by Bloomberg had forecast a 4.6 per cent decline in Nodx, after shipments shrank 3.3 per cent in January.  But on a month-on-month seasonally adjusted basis, Nodx dropped 4.8 per cent in February compared with January. Non-electronic domestic exports declined while shipments of electronics grew, the ESG said. The level of Nodx reached $14 billion last month, compared with the $14.7 billion in January.  SIM Global Education senior lecturer Tan Khay Boon said that the decline in the seasonally-adjusted month-on-month figures shows that demand for exports from Singapore was still weak.  Dr Tan said: \u201cThe improvement in (last month\u2019s year-on-year figures) was a more technical one due to the low base in 2019.\u201d  He added: \u201cWith more and more countries enforcing a lockdown due to the Covid-19 outbreak, external trade is bound to weaken with weaknesses in both demand and supply.\u201d  Still, not all is bleak. Barclays Bank economist Brian Tan said: \u201cBeyond the expected favourable base effect from the earlier Lunar New Year holiday this year, the sequential decline was also milder than we had anticipated.\u201d  In February, exports of electronics grew by 2.5 per cent from a year ago, while exports of non-electronics expanded 3.2 per cent in the same period, according to Enterprise Singapore data on Tuesday (March 17).  Parts of integrated circuits, capacitors and disk media products led the export growth in electronics.  Export of integrated circuits grew 130.9 per cent while capacitors increased 128.8 per cent. Exports of disk media products grew 57.4 per cent. Electronic exports had fallen 13 per cent in January.  For non-electronic exports last month, specialised machinery, non-electric engines and motors and pharmaceuticals were the best performers.

If employees do not have enough annual leave, employers may require them to use advance leave or take no-pay leave, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the National Trades Union Congress and the Singapore National Employers Federation said in a joint statement on Monday (March 16).  This comes in the wake of wider border restrictions as Singapore moves to reduce the risk of Covid-19 importation.  Employers should remind employees of the latest Health Ministry+s travel advisory to defer all non-essential travel plans to all countries, and also obtain a travel declaration from their workers for their upcoming overseas plans, the tripartite partners said.  In the latest border restrictions that were announced by the Government on Sunday, from 11.59pm on Monday, all travellers - including Singapore citizens, permanent residents, long-term pass holders and short-term visitors - entering Singapore with recent travel history to Asean countries, Japan, Switzerland or the United Kingdom within the last 14 days will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice.  But this will exclude Singaporeans and Malaysians using sea and land crossings with Malaysia, given the large numbers who cross these borders daily.  For employers and self-employed workers who proceed with travel plans after Sunday, they will not be eligible for the $100 daily support when affected workers serve out their mandatory stay-home requirements.  Previously on Feb 21, MOM had said that employers should not force their staff to take leave for their mandatory 14-day stay-home notice or leave of absence or risk having their work pass privileges suspended.  But in other guidelines issued on Monday, employers are also expected to provide additional paid leave for workers who proceed with work-related travel plans if necessary.

This is on top of building up the country+s inventory of food and essential supplies, he said on Facebook.  He gave this assurance following concerns among Singaporeans over the implications of Malaysia\u2019s announcement earlier on Monday that it will restrict all movement throughout the country from Wednesday until March 31 to prevent further spread of the coronavirus within the country.  All Malaysians will be barred from travelling abroad. For those who are returning from overseas, they must undergo a health inspection and undergo self-quarantine for 14 days.  There will also be a ban on all foreign tourists and visitors.  Photos of queues at various supermarkets here on Monday evening started circulating online after Malaysia\u2019s announcement, with shoppers snapping up food products and daily necessities.  Mr Chan added that the Republic is not facing any immediate risks of running out of food or other supplies brought in by retailers.  He explained that this is because the Singapore Government has been actively working with supermarket chains such as NTUC FairPrice, Sheng Siong and Dairy Farm to increase the country+s stock of food and essential supplies over the last two months.  On ensuring the country does not run out of essentials, Mr Chan said that Singapore has local production capabilities for products such as noodles, infant milk powder and canned goods among others.  \u201cIn the event that we need to increase supply for our domestic consumption, we can ramp up quickly and easily to do so,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe have also continued to diversify our sources of essential goods, for example we get a good amount of vegetables from China and even go as far as Australia and Spain to secure our supply of eggs.\u201d  Even so, Mr Chan urged Singaporeans to continue to purchase in a responsible manner and to purchase only what they need. +Otherwise, no amount of stockpiling will be sufficient.+  On Monday night, Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced movement restrictions on the country, from Wednesday until March 31.

He also said that food and medical supplies including face masks will be sufficient.  The limits include a ban on mass gatherings, including religious, sports, social and cultural events.  With the latest development in Malaysia, Mr Chan said that businesses that employ Malaysian workers who commute between Singapore and Malaysia daily may have to activate their business continuity plans.  \u201cIf they need assistance, they should contact our economic agencies who stand ready to assist,\u201d he said, adding that Singapore will also continue to stay in touch with Malaysia, and to ensure that businesses and people are able to continue with their lives and livelihoods.  \u201cI am aware that many of these new restrictions and announcements may be quite overwhelming for many people. I ask for your continued trust and support as we work hard with all stakeholders to ensure that we get through these short-term challenges together,\u201d said Mr Chan.  For now, consumers like Madam Catherine Heng, 50, are worried about Malaysia\u2019s restrictions but also note that it lasts about two weeks.  She decided to stock up for the weekend just to be on the safe side, buying potatoes, carrots, spinach and a tray of eggs.  \u201cYou can\u2019t keep fresh vegetables for too long anyway - the only things that can keep are the potatoes and carrots,\u201d she said.  Another shopper, who only wanted to be known as Madam Ng, said she went to a FairPrice outlet in Yishun to stock up on essential supplies as she was afraid the Malaysia restrictions would result in a supply cut.  Madam Ng, who works in telecommunications, went to the supermarket with her daughter and two sons after reading about Malaysia\u2019s move, and said that among the things she bought were two 10kg bags of rice.  \u201cWhen we came at about 11pm, it was not so crowded. But the crowd suddenly grew very big,\u201d she said, adding that she will return on Tuesday to stock up on vegetables which were not available.  Mr Kelvin Sin, 38, said he rushed down to the FairPrice outlet near his Yishun home with his brother on hearing the news.  \u201cEveryone feels nervous. We are afraid we can\u2019t get supplies of things like fresh meat,\u201d he said.  Financial analyst Radhika Singh, 36, also headed to the Giant supermarket in Toa Payoh on hearing of Malaysia+s announcement and got a large tray of eggs, canned tuna, pasta and spinach. She said she needed to stock up as her three children will be eating most of their meals at home this week, as it is the school holidays.  \u201cThis should be enough for two weeks and hopefully the situation will be resolved by then,\u201d she said.  As for one owner of a food import-export firm at Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre, he was not too worried.  The owner, who wanted to be known only as Mr Chia, believes there are definitely enough stocks, in part because the market has been very slow and \u201cwe have a lot of vegetables coming from other countries\u201d.  \u201cWe don\u2019t know the full impact of the situation yet, but my friends in Malaysia, the suppliers, say the supply coming into Singapore will not be affected,\u201d he added, though he noted things could change later.  - Additional reporting by Linette Lai, Fabian Koh, Tee Zhuo","79":"SINGAPORE - While the global coronavirus pandemic has provoked fear in some people, others have been making a special effort to create and post light-hearted videos about the coronavirus.

Posting the second-strongest February sales performance in eight years, developers moved 975 private homes \u2013 up 57.3 per cent from the 620 units they sold the month before, driven by competitively-priced new projects. The latest figure is also 114 per cent higher than the 455 units developers sold in February last year.  The data excludes executive condominium (EC) units, for which there was pent-up demand, with Parc Canberra in Sembawang, the only new EC launch so far this year.  Including ECs, which are a public-private housing hybrid, developers found buyers for 1,314 units last month, up 105.3 per cent from the 640 units they sold in January and 187.5 per cent more than the 457 units sold in February last year.  \u201cWhile we remain cautiously optimistic about home sales, much would depend on the economic fallout from the (virus) outbreak and whether there are large-scale job losses, widespread retrenchments. (That) will certainly dampen housing demand,\u201d Ms Tricia Song, head of research for Singapore, Colliers International, said.  But for now, persistently low interest rates are helping to support housing demand. The US Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates to near zero and restarted its quantitative easing programme as part of emergency stimulus.  \u201cMortgage rates based on the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (Sibor), on which most home loans are priced, have come off 30-40 basis points (bps), since the first 50-bps rate cut by the Fed, and should come off further,\u201d Ms Song said.  Urban Redevelopment Authority data yesterday shows the number of units launched jumped 56 per cent to 933 in February, from 598 the previous month, and up 56.5 per cent to 596 from a year ago.  February\u2019s top sellers included new launches The M, which sold 380 of the 522-unit condo project in Bugis, and the 496-unit Parc Canberra EC, which moved 324 units.  Many buyers were drawn to The M\u2019s location near the Bugis MRT station, Bugis Junction and Suntec City. \u201cPrice quantum continued to be a driver, with 97.9 per cent of all sales in The M below $2 million,\u201d said CBRE head of research for Singapore and South-east Asia Desmond Sim.  Other top sellers included existing projects such as Treasure at Tampines (97 units), Parc Esta (53 units), Jadescape (46 units) and Parc Botannia (40 units). Ms Christine Sun, Orange Tee & Tie\u2019s head of research & consultancy, attributed the robust sales to more investors diversifying their portfolios after the recent stock market rout.

The festival, slated for April 6, is celebrated by Hindus and held in honour of the Hindu god Murugan.  Devotees usually bear kavadis, pull chariots or carry milk pots, as they walk about 1.2km to seek blessings and fulfil their vows. The temple management committee at the Holy Tree Sri Balasubramaniar Temple in Yishun decided to scrap the procession this year, citing coronavirus clusters which came about at large gatherings in crowded settings, including places of worship.  The committee had discussed alternative options but found it +difficult to organise a scaled-down procession+, said temple chairman Narainasamy in a statement yesterday.+In addition, maintaining social distancing among devotees and keeping contact tracing records will be very challenging. In arriving at this decision, we took the view that the health and safety of our devotees is paramount.+  Every year, the Panguni Uthiram chariot and foot procession draws 10,000 to 15,000 devotees who gather in close proximity to one another, both along the procession route and in the temple. The procession takes place within Yishun Industrial Park A, where the temple is located.  For this year, priests will still conduct prayers on the day, but limit the number of devotees in the temple to not more than 250, said the committee.  The decision comes after the Government implemented social distancing measures on Friday as a major line of defence in the battle against the outbreak. The measures involve not having more than 250 attendees at large private functions and religious services.  Staff and priests at the temple already have their temperature checked twice daily, but from today this will also be extended to devotees who visit the temple.  The committee will also limit to 250 the number of devotees in the temple at any given time.","86":"SINGAPORE - Be prepared for the long haul and be organised.

We communicate with our people, people understand what we are doing.+  In the interview with CNBC presenters Sri Jegarajah and Martin Soong, Dr Balakrishnan - an eye doctor before he went into politics - also spoke about how Covid-19 and its economic aftermath is going to last +at least a year, which means anything we do needs to be sustainable and sensible for the long term+.  He also spoke about +test kit diplomacy+.  +What we need to do as a world is to share best practices, to rapidly develop test kits, vaccines, antivirals. We need to share the fruits of applied research. We need to coordinate our measures.+  Asked about the timing of the general election, he said: +You will have to ask the Prime Minister that.+  He added: +But the election is not the most important thing right now. The most important thing is that we get over this. We get over this together, and we get over this together with our neighbouring countries, our region and at the global level. This is a time to focus on delivery, on getting things done. The politics will take care of itself.+  Here is a transcript of the interview:  Presenter (Sri Jegarajah): I am very pleased to say that Vivian Balakrishnan, Singapore+s Minister for Foreign Affairs, joins us now for a CNBC exclusive interview. Minister, thank you very much for joining us today. Where do we go from here, in terms of Singapore+s response, because the number of cases has been rising? We have seen a very, very determined effort by the authorities here to contain the situation. But I am just wondering, there is a narrative now about even closing schools and raising the Dorscon (Disease Outbreak Response System Condition) level even higher. Do we need to go there?  Minister: I think we should first set it in context. This is a global phenomenon. It is all but a pandemic. You just revealed it is 113,000 cases worldwide. In fact, most of the new cases are now arising outside of China. I think the first point I want to make is that this is a global phenomenon. Maps which do not reveal any cases probably are indications of a lack of testing. So that is the first point - it is worldwide. The next point I want to make is going to sound a bit scary for financial markets. It is that this problem and its aftermath - its economic aftermath - is going to last at least a year, which means anything we do needs to be sustainable and sensible for the long term. The next point, which is worth thinking through, is that if you look at mortality rates across the world, we believe the key reason for variation is the adequacy of your healthcare systems. Which means, as long as your healthcare systems are not overwhelmed, we believe you can get mortality rates to about 1 per cent, hopefully even lower. Those are three things which you need to understand.  Sri Jegarajah: What makes you think that the situation is going to drive on for at least a year? The economic ripple effects.  Minister: Because you can see that the genie is out of the bottle. If this had been like Sars, confined to East Asia - China, Japan, Korea, Singapore - and given the kind of social and medical procedures that we could take, there was a chance for containment. Now that it has exploded, you look in East Asia, at Iran, at Italy; and watch the numbers in the United States. Unfortunately, I think the genie is out of the bottle.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Related Story Interactive: How coronavirus is spreading across the world  Sri Jegarajah: Do we have to be concerned about recession?  Minister: That is just a matter of numbers. I think you have to be concerned about a major impact because it is a global phenomenon, and it is going to last quite some time. In the case of Sars, let me speak from a medical perspective, it took us about four months to get over. It took us probably about six months for the economic impact to wear out. This time, it is going to be longer, and it is going to be all countries. You need to be psychologically prepared. If I zoom in now to Singapore, in the initial phase, it was obviously about border control - preventing the import of cases. The next phase is hard containment, which means identify, isolate, treat, keep mortality low. Beyond that, you have another phase of delay, meaning you want to ensure that the peak of the epidemic does not exceed the intensive care capacity of your systems. That means a whole host of social distancing and other measures, which by the way, have not only a social impact, but also an economic impact. All governments have to adopt the right balance for the circumstances that they confront. Then you get to mitigation. In the case of Singapore, we are continuing to maintain border controls. We are checking everyone that comes in very, very carefully. But now that we recognise that this is a global phenomenon and Singapore cannot lock itself out of the world nor can we shut down, it means from time to time, we will be importing cases. In fact, if you speak to the Chinese - and I have been in touch with them - I think they are now more worried about importation of cases into China rather than their own containment efforts locally.  Sri Jegarajah: I am glad you mentioned China. The fact that Xi Jinping is now visiting Wuhan, optically does that suggest that China is near or at an all clear?  Minister: I think when you are dealing with an epidemic of a new virus, you are never complacent about it. For both China and Singapore, we may have handled the first phase reasonably well, but we will not be complacent. You should not sound the all-clear. I think President Xi+s visit to Wuhan is part of his overall campaign to make sure that the situation is under control across the whole of China. It is an enormous effort that they have undertaken.  Presenter (Martin Soong): Minister, you mentioned that the new risk is importation now. The Costa Fortuna that was allowed to dock in Singapore yesterday with more than 2,000 passengers - walk and talk us through exactly what was done with and for the passengers to mitigate the risk of importation.  Minister: First of all, I need to tell you that Singapore was its home port. Secondly, every single passenger on board embarked on that cruise from Singapore. They have been tested and checked before they got on board. They had to come back here because it is the home port, and this is where the cruise was scheduled to end. Having said that, in an abundance of caution, we checked every single passenger. Then we accompanied them to the airport. I think by now, most of them have probably left.  Sri Jegarajah: Can I confirm that there are 60 Italian nationals on board the vessel and that they are clear?  Minister: They were all clear, they were all well before they even embarked on the cruise. I think the point about cruise ships and this virus is that if you do not maintain strict levels of discipline, hygiene and containment, ships and cruises are very dangerous. But if they started off clean and you maintain that, and you monitor that very carefully, it can be done. I am not recommending people to go on cruises right now; I am just explaining to you why it had to come back to Singapore, how we handled it, and that it can be handled safely.  Martin Soong: Singapore+s policy response to coronavirus, the execution as well, has been held up in multiple places as a model for how this should be handled by the government, and probably rightly so as well. You are, as Foreign Minister, Singapore+s face to the world, with regard to how the island is handling this crisis. Let me ask you for the people at home - 166 cases. We have noticed in the last two, three days or so, the number of confirmed infections has jumped. We are into triple digits now. How concerned should people be?  Minister: I think we should remain eternally vigilant. From time to time, a case, if it goes under the radar and someone with the virus is actively participating in social events - that person can spread. I think that is very clear. In fact, that is what has happened in this case. That is why we are taking additional precautions, as I said, on social distancing - cancelling or postponing some events, especially if it involves more senior citizens because they are more vulnerable. These measures need to be taken. The point I am trying to make is that this is going to be with us for one year. From time to time, cases will come in; and from time to time, a cluster will pop up. It is important to identify early, go into quarantine, contact trace. We can damp it down. But even when we damp down this cluster, keep a lookout for the next. We have to be in this position for quite some time. That is the point I am making.  Sri Jegarajah: It is very clear that the Government and all the agencies under the Government are not letting down their guard. They are not getting complacent in the least. But I am just wondering, Minister, do you have a working time frame as to when we can see an endpoint to the virus, to this outbreak? Because we have been hearing a lot about the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, it tends to burn itself out, it tends to die a natural death when we are talking about this virus. Does the Government have a working time frame on when that potentially could happen?  Minister: Let me speak as a doctor. This is a new virus. It is very dangerous and wishful to believe that it will behave according to previous viruses. We do not make the assumption that this will disappear in the summer months. The situation that we are in right now, there are two possibilities. One is that this becomes a global pandemic and the impact would be horrendous. The other possibility is that it becomes endemic, which means it becomes part of the background viral load in the population.  Sri Jegarajah: Do you feel it is a pandemic in all but name on a global basis?  Minister: I think we should be prepared. We should assume the worst, even if we are hoping for the best. You know the Singapore Government - we take things very, very seriously. We prepare for the worst. We get all our measures lined up, coordinated. We communicate with our people, people understand what we are doing. My main point I am leaving with you today is - be prepared for the long haul and be organised. It is not just whole-of-government, it is whole-of-nation. In fact, this is an acid test of every single country+s quality of healthcare, standard of governance and social capital. If any one of this tripod is weak, it will be exposed, and exposed quite unmercifully by this epidemic.  Martin Soong: Minister, I do not mean to put you in an uncomfortable position, but because you are Foreign Minister I am obligated to ask you about this. We have been talking this morning about how markets have come back; rebounded, and strongly. It is because they are hoping or betting that the Trump administration is going to come out with some sort of fiscal package to offset the negative impact of the coronavirus. But now, they are pricing in disappointment because a press conference promised yesterday is apparently not going to eventuate. More broadly, there is this sense that the US is almost laughably far behind in terms of preparedness to fight this virus. Is that fair?  Minister: I would not want to engage in that kind of polemic. As I said just now this is a critical, clear, and present danger to all countries. And it is a test of preparedness on all fronts - healthcare, governance and social capital. The United States has enormous resources at its disposal. It is a matter of getting it organised and delivered. So let us wait and see. And I would never count the Americans out.  Sri Jegarajah: There is a perception that Europe, now, is the new epicentre of this virus outbreak. What is your message to Singaporeans who are choosing to travel there either for business, study, leisure, or who are already there?  Minister: Well most Singaporeans who are in Italy have returned. And we are keeping tabs on every single one. In my ministry, one of our functions is to keep track of Singaporeans who go overseas and who may run into trouble. And we have given the commitment that we will leave no Singaporean behind. We are also asking everyone to eRegister so that we can communicate, we can stay in close touch. So that is the privilege of citizenship. A crisis is also a test of the value of your citizenship, of your society, and of your government. That is what we are all confronting.  Martin Soong: Minister I have to ask you this. One of your Cabinet colleagues, Lawrence Wong, this was yesterday, was talking about the possibility of closing schools in Singapore. To date, this is not a measure that the Government has decided it wants to, or needs to, undertake. Let me ask you - how close is the Government to closing schools, what would it take to trigger that kind of response?  Minister: Again, to put it in context, closing schools is just one of a suite of measures for social distancing. The key parameter for judgment is whether you need to take such extreme measures because you are worried that your infection rate will exceed your treatment capacity. It is a very dynamic thing, and we have to watch this very closely. But just to give you an idea of numbers. The latest data indicates that in 19 days, if you miss it, the number of cases will increase by a factor of 10. That is actually what happened, probably, in Europe and in Iran. In the case of Singapore, we are determined not to take our eyes off the ball. Watch out for our announcements on a daily basis because we are watching this very closely. We know how quickly things can move. It is that vigilance, quick action, coordinated action and ability to not just announce things, but to deliver it. One great advantage we have in Singapore is not just being able to deliver, but that our people do it. That social capital of trust and compliance when the chips are down in an extreme situation is absolutely crucial.  Martin Soong: You talked about the capacity to manage this crisis in terms of human resources, in terms of physical capacity as well. Hospitals, healthcare system, et cetera. We have had the number of infections jump to double digits in the last two, three days or so, and we have a number of patients in ICU also, almost double...  Minister: We have about nine, last I checked. About nine cases in ICU. It is no accident that so far, we have had zero mortality. I cannot assume that we will have zero mortality; that is not possible. If you look at the experience of China, mortality is higher in areas where you have overwhelmed your intensive care capacity. In the case of Singapore - I have spoken to the doctors on the front line, and they tell me - we have got the resources, staff, equipment. We have the bandwidth to do our best for these patients. That is the key difference. We have more than enough capacity for now, and our objective is to make sure that we always stay ahead of the curve. But let me tell you as a doctor, these are things you cannot just build up overnight. It takes years and years of investment in people, in systems, in capacity. From a foreign policy point of view, we now have test kit diplomacy. What we need to do as a world is to share best practices, to rapidly develop test kits, vaccines, antivirals. We need to share the fruits of applied research. We need to coordinate our measures. If you look globally at what is happening - in China, they are trying to reboot their economy. In Japan and Korea, they are trying to get to grips with community transmission. In Italy, it has had to adopt some possibly unthinkable measures, and to lock down the whole of Italy. And the rest of the world should be on standby, and make sure we do all that it takes to ensure that we do not overwhelm healthcare facilities.  Related Story Coronavirus: How flattening the epidemic curve will buy time and keep outbreak in check  Related Story Coronavirus: Why staying home when unwell can save lives  Sri Jegarajah: Minister, I have lived here for 20 years and I have got to say that the response; I have seen Sars, and I have seen the response here to Covid-19. It has been nothing short of remarkable and the Government is on a crisis footing. Nonetheless, I hope you do not think this a fatuous question - but is this going to affect the timing of the election?  Minister: You will have to ask the Prime Minister that. But the election is not the most important thing right now. The most important thing is that we get over this. We get over this together, and we get over this together with our neighbouring countries, our region, and at the global level. This is a time to focus on delivery, on getting things done. The politics will take care of itself.  Sri Jegarajah: Do you think that this changes the relationship between Singapore and China?  Minister: The relationship between Singapore and China is excellent. Let me give you some data for that. It is true that we were one of the first to announce some travel measures. But I can tell you that China has also told me that they understood. They understood our unique circumstances as a tiny hyper-connected, trans-shipment and travel hub - why we needed to be even more careful than others. Secondly, there has been close communication, both at the political and professional levels. The fact that China published the genome in early-January was the reason why we were also able to develop PCR test kits, which, in a nice circle, we were able to provide them when they needed some additional help. Now, we are continuing to discuss, not only overcoming the problem in the containment phase, but we are also looking beyond that. Beyond this phase, beyond this month, for the next one year - how do we reboot the economy? How do we handle a sustainable posture for travel? And how do we keep life going? There is also a fallacy that there is a trade-off between healthcare and the economy. Actually, they are both sides of the same coin. If you do not have an economy, if you do not have resources which you can devote for healthcare and keeping your society going, you then face a very sticky situation. We are working very closely with China. I can tell you our relations are excellent, based on trust, and based on a long track record of interaction.  Sri Jegarajah: Can I pick up on your point about test kit diplomacy? When you look at your neighbours and partners within the region, I am thinking specifically about Indonesia where there has been very few cases reported. Is that symptomatic of a lack of testing facilities and test kits, and is Singapore out there helping Indonesia? Are you concerned about imported cases from Indonesia? We do not really have a clear idea of the situation there.  Minister: Let us again put things in context. We have the world+s busiest land crossing. Every day 300,000 people cross between Malaysia and Singapore. Four of the world+s 10 most busy air routes are in Asean. Singapore-KL, Singapore-Jakarta, Bangkok-Jakarta, et cetera. Thirty-seven per cent of all travel within Asean is intra-Asean travel. I have told my fellow foreign ministers we are actually one hot zone. We are all in it together. I can tell you, without revealing details, that we are sharing information, we are sharing capacity, and we are coordinating our measures. We are in it together and we cannot resolve this unless the whole world, and in particular for us in our region, Asean, gets it right.  Martin Soong: So we are directing assistance to Indonesia, also to Malaysia?  Minister: We are working very closely with them both, very, very closely. It is not just a form of words to say +We are in the same boat+. This virus has shown that it does not respect passports, boundaries, politics. It is time to work together. Finger pointing, making unnecessary comments are not helpful. Let us just get on with it.  Martin Soong: I need to sneak in one final question which is totally unrelated to the coronavirus; or if not, only obliquely here. The situation that has been going on with oil - there is a price war that has erupted; Saudi Arabia, Russia. It seems as though Russia is targeting the US and US shale, which makes us wonder. The Trump administration, should it be, is it going to be, reaching out to MBS (Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman) and the Saudis - they have a more direct line there - or is it going to be - (US President Donald Trump) calls his buddy (Russian President Vladimir Putin) on the phone and goes +Look, listen, you have got to help us out here+. What happens here?  Related Story Coronavirus: Timeline of events so far  Minister: That is a profound question with many answers. Number one, the world is undergoing an energy transformation. The whole question of fossil fuels, renewables, that needs to be sorted out. Number two, the main change in fossil fuels has been the advent of shale oil and gas, and the fact that the United States is now independent, energy independent. That is a major phenomenon for which I think people have not yet completely understood the ramifications. The next point is that this virus has also brought to a head the fact that you are going to get multiple downstream impacts on the economy. First, you get the immediate fear, which immediately has an impact on tourism, hotels, retail, and the rest of it. The secondary impact is on supply chains. We did not have time to discuss it today, but supply chain disruption has got profound impact on economic growth, everywhere. The third impact is on energy. You have a demand side collapse, at least in the immediate to medium term; you have got a systemic problem, because of shale gas. Those are the challenges. My expectation is great volatility economically: equities, commodities.  Martin Soong: Minister, fantastic talking to you. Thank you so much for your time.  Minister: Thank you. All the best.","87":"SINGAPORE - National carrier Singapore Airlines (SIA) is waiving all rebooking fees for tickets issued on or before Sunday (March 15), for travel up to May 31.  Customers can cancel their existing flight itineraries and rebook their flight at a later date, for trips to be completed by March 31, 2021, the airline said on Sunday.  This comes after Singapore further tightened border restrictions and advised residents to defer all non-essential travel on Sunday.  SIA said that all rebooking fees will be waived, although a fare difference may apply for new bookings.  It will also waive change fees for all new SIA and SilkAir tickets issued from Sunday to March 31, it added.  The airline said it will continue to review its waiver policy and could extend the cut-off date beyond May 31 as it assesses the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on global air travel in the coming weeks.  Customers are urged to contact the airline for assistance only for flights departing within the next 72 hours.  This is to allow agents to focus on and assist those with urgent flight changes, SIA said.  On Saturday, SIA announced that it would be suspending flights to European cities including Milan, Barcelona, Paris, Munich and Frankfurt.

Dr Lam, who is Senior Minister of State for Health and Transport, told The Straits Times that he met Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC MP Teo Ser Luck and Punggol East MP Charles Chong last Friday (March 13) after the release of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee+s report.  +According to the electoral boundaries, these areas (under Sengkang GRC) are under our care, and it+s only right that we start meeting up to make the necessary arrangements,+ said Dr Lam.  He added: +It was an initial meeting to work out what are the things we need to do, like a local manifesto, GRC manifesto, who+s in charge of what.+  He was at a Sengkang West grassroots event at Marina Barrage on Sunday.  While the slate of candidates for the new four-member GRC has not been confirmed, Dr Lam said he +assumes+ that he will stay on, alongside Mr Teo, +unless (Mr Teo) is being deployed elsewhere+.  +Of course, when the slate of candidates is confirmed, we will bring the relevant people in,+ he added.  Dr Lam, who entered politics in 2006, noted that his grassroots activists are ready for an election, and have been preparing since before the coronavirus outbreak.  +Preparations wise we are ready, but now that the EBRC has released the report saying we are part of Sengkang GRC, that requires us to work as a team.+  He said the style of preparations for the election as a GRC will be different compared to his experience helming Sengkang West, where they would +decide and then execute+.

This applies to all ActiveSG stadiums, sports halls, gyms, swimming complexes and studios, and its facilities will implement a single point of entry where possible to facilitate temperature taking and recording of visitor details.  These enhanced precautionary measures follow the latest advisory from the Ministry of Health (MOH), which contains new guidelines including deferring or cancelling ticketed events with 250 participants or more.  SportSG also urged national sports associations and its other partners to strictly follow MOH guidelines.  SportSG chief executive officer Lim Teck Yin noted that actions such as physical distancing, wiping sports equipment down after use and refraining from visiting the premises while ill are ways that Singaporeans can do their part.  +We have come up with these measures to enable socially responsible behaviour. Regulating the number of people at our facilities helps to increase personal space and allows one to adopt physical distancing,+ he added.  Regulated access to gyms will be implemented according to the size of the respective facility, with notices to be displayed and queue numbers issued if the gym is at full capacity. Programmes conducted at ActiveSG studios will also be held outdoors.  Children+s pools at ActiveSG swimming complexes will be closed until further notice, with temperature taking and visitor registration taking place at all pools.  For indoor sports halls that are shared by groups for activities like badminton and table tennis, only alternate courts will be available to limit the number of patrons within the hall and maintain some physical distance between users. Some court bookings from March 16 will be cancelled and refunded accordingly. There will be no changes to squash and tennis court bookings and usage.

In a statement on Sunday (March 15), the opposition party said it understands there is a lot of speculation and excitement over when the GE will be called due to the release of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee+s report.  +In line with past experience, the general election is usually called very soon after the report+s release,+ said the WP.  However, the party +recognises the situation facing Singapore at present is different+ and that there are worries about the spread of Covid-19 and its impact on the economy, it said, as it added that it does not want to partake in speculation.

He noted in a Facebook post that the Covid-19 outbreak will likely persist through this year, and quite possibly longer, adding that the country has two options ahead.  The first is to hope and pray that things will stabilise before the end of the Government+s term so that elections can be held under more normal circumstances.  +But we have no certainty of that,+ he said.  +Or else call elections early, knowing that we are going into a hurricane, to elect a new government with a fresh mandate and a full term ahead of it, which can work with Singaporeans on the critical tasks at hand.+  If elections have to be held before Covid-19 is over, all necessary precautions will be taken so that parties can campaign effectively and people can vote safely, he added.

All employers and employment agencies planning for their foreign domestic workers to enter Singapore will also need to obtain the MOM+s approval before the workers commence their journey.  These measures, taken in view of the rapid spread of Covid-19 worldwide, would affect both new and returning workers.  They would take effect from 11.59pm on Monday.  +The new measures take into consideration that FDWs live with families and many look after young children and the elderly,+ said the MOM.  It said all new incoming foreign domestic workers must serve their stay-home notices at an alternative accommodation (dormitories, hostels or hotels) before they can be deployed for employment.  For domestic workers returning from overseas, their employers can arrange for them to serve the notice in the employer+s residential address, or alternative accommodation.  On the entry approval for the domestic workers, the MOM said the application can be done online.  The applicant - either the employer or the employment agency - will be responsible for ensuring that the domestic worker complies with the stay-home notice.  They also have to ensure that the worker has access to a local mobile phone and remains contactable by the MOM during the 14-day period.  The ministry said that employers and agencies should ask the domestic worker not to make travel plans until approval is obtained.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  +The employment agencies or employers will be required to send the MOM approval letter to the FDWs, who will need to show it to the airline staff during check-in and at the ICA checkpoint upon arrival in Singapore,+ said the MOM.  It also said that it is the collective responsibility of all involved to ensure that the new requirements are complied with.  +Enforcement action, including revocation of work passes and suspension of work pass privileges, will be taken if the requirements are not complied with,+ the MOM added.  +Demerit points will also be imposed on agencies whose actions result in violation of the requirements by the FDWs.+  Employers of domestic workers who do not serve their stay-home notices at the employer+s registered residential addresses can apply to tap a support package from the MOM.  This package will allow eligible employers who are Singapore citizens or permanent residents to get $60 support daily per affected domestic worker and have their levy waived during the stay-home notice period.  More details on the application process will be made known at a later stage.

But separate arrangements for precautions are being worked out by a bilateral joint working group, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said on Sunday (March 15).  The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Sunday announced that from 11.59pm on Monday, all travellers - including Singapore citizens, permanent residents, long-term pass holders, and short-term visitors - entering Singapore with recent travel history to Asean countries, Japan, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom within the last 14 days will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice (SHN).  But Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the coronavirus outbreak, said such restrictions on those coming in from Malaysia would be complex.  He noted that 300,000 people move across the land crossings at the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints alone on a daily basis.  +We do have to put in place some special considerations for Malaysia because of the close proximity and the high inter-dependency between our two countries,+ said Mr Wong.  +So for now, the arrangements which I just described will not apply to our sea and land crossings with Malaysia.+  Malaysia reported 190 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, with most linked to a religious event at a mosque that was attended by more than 10,000 people from several countries.  The new cases bring the total number of infections in the country to 428.  Mr Wong added: +We do need precautions to be taken at these checkpoints, but it is going to be more complex, given the high volume of people moving in and out of these checkpoints.  +We want precautions to be taken there, and so separate arrangements are being worked out by the bilateral joint working group we have with Malaysia.+","93":"SINGAPORE - It was business as usual for MP Henry Kwek this weekend, even as his Kebun Baru ward has been carved out as a single-member constituency in the coming general election.

But by then, they had visited 10 mosques in Singapore during their infectious period.  Congregants who visited these mosques during certain time frames may have been exposed to a Covid-19 case, said the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) in a statement on Sunday (March 15).  Covid-19 is the disease caused by the coronavirus.  The affected mosques are Masjid Al-Iman, Masjid Al-Muttaqin, Masjid Hajjah Fatimah, Masjid Hajah Rahimabi Kebun Limau, Masjid Kassim, Masjid Petempatan Melayu Sembawang, Masjid Sultan, Masjid Al-Mawaddah, Masjid Jamae (Chulia) and Masjid Al-Istiqamah.  The confirmed cases had visited these mosques at various periods of time from March 3 to 11.  Muis advises congregants who had visited these mosques to monitor their health closely for two weeks from their last visit to the affected mosque.  They should look out for fever or respiratory symptoms such as a cough, sore throat, runny nose or breathlessness, and seek medical attention promptly if they have these symptoms or feel unwell.  They should also wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit to inform the clinic doctor of their attendance at the affected activities that are linked to the confirmed Covid-19 cases, said Muis.  Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli urged Singaporeans who wish to attend similar gatherings overseas to review their plans as social distancing measures might not be strictly implemented by the organisers.  \u201cIf you do decide to go or have gone, please report yourselves to the authorities upon your return,\u201d he said in a Facebook post on Sunday, after Muis released its statement.  He wrote: \u201cThese are challenging times, but let us take comfort in the fact that we are mobilising all our resources, to keep this virus at bay.\u201d  In its statement, the Council also reminded members of the public to be socially responsible and exercise personal hygiene. See a doctor when unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, and stay at home to prevent spreading illness to others, it said.  Members of the public should also keep to the same family physician for better continuity of care, isolate themselves at home when unwell and as advised by a doctor, wash their hands frequently with soap and water, and avoid touching their faces.

Flights to more than 50 destinations have been suspended in view of the tight travel restrictions being imposed by many countries, the airline said in a notice on its website on Friday (March 20).  Some routes to Malaysia are on hold until end-March, when a partial lockdown there is scheduled to end. But most of the suspensions will last till mid-April at least.  Meanwhile, its two European routes to Berlin and Athens will be suspended till end-May.  All affected customers will be notified progressively and will receive a Scoot travel voucher on the unused portion of their itinerary within 30 business days.  The Straits Times has contacted Scoot for more information on the flight suspensions.  According to its website, Scoot flies to more than 60 destinations, including Singapore.  It said that beyond the suspended routes, it is also making frequency adjustments on other routes and will notify affected customers directly.  +Scoot is continuing to monitor the situation and will make adjustments to our network as necessary,+ it added.  Related Story Lockdowns not enough to defeat coronavirus, says leading World Health Organisation expert  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Airlines worldwide have been hard hit by the coronavirus outbreak, which has led to demand for air travel plunging.

The International Air Transport Association has said that airlines stand to lose as much as US$113 billion (S$163 billion) in revenue this year due to the pandemic.  Various countries worldwide have already shut their borders or introduced tougher border controls. Singapore also tightened its borders on Sunday, and will bar entry and transit to all short-term visitors from 11.59pm on Monday.

For now, there are no plans for retrenchments, The Straits Times understands.  Hours after SIA announced on Monday that it was cutting 96 per cent of its scheduled capacity till end-April and grounding 138 out of 147 SIA and SilkAir aircraft, chief executive Goh Choon Phong issued a staff circular on the latest cost-cutting moves.  In the note seen by ST, he said that SIA management will take a second round of pay cuts. Instead of 15 per cent as previously announced, Mr Goh said he will take a 30 per cent cut from April 1.  Pay cuts for other affected senior staff will range from 10 to 25 per cent. SIA board members will take a 30 per cent cut in their fees.  Mr Goh added that the airline has also reached agreement with its unions on a set of cost-cutting measures.  These include varying days of compulsory no-pay leave every month for pilots, executives and associates; as well as furlough for staff on re-employment contracts.  The measures will impact about 10,000 staff.  Before the latest measures, SIA had already rolled out a voluntary no-pay leave scheme to staff, including cabin crew.  SIA said its low-cost unit Scoot will also suspend most of its network, resulting in the grounding of 47 of its fleet of 49 aircraft.  In a release on Monday morning, SIA said that it is more vulnerable to international markets restricting the free movement of people or banning air travel because it does not have a domestic segment.

Australia, for instance, said last Thursday that it is closing its borders to all visitors indefinitely.  The United States has also closed its borders with Canada and Mexico and banned inbound travellers who had been to any of more than 25 listed countries up to two weeks before their arrival. Singapore on Sunday likewise said that all short-term visitors will no longer be allowed to enter or transit through the country from 11.59pm on Monday.  In this travel-hostile environment, SIA said that it is actively taking steps to build up its liquidity, and to reduce capital expenditure and operating costs.  The measures that it is taking include discussions with aircraft manufacturers to defer upcoming aircraft deliveries and, if agreed, it will consequently defer payment for those aircraft deliveries.  In the past few days, the SIA Group has drawn on its lines of credit to meet its immediate cash flow requirements and it is in discussion with several financial institutions for its future funding requirements.  +The company continues to explore measures to shore up its liquidity during this unprecedented disruption to global air travel,+ it said, adding: +The company will release further details when such measures have been firmed up.+  Until this crisis hit, SIA was the 15th largest airline group in the world, serving around 140 destinations in more than 35 countries and territories.","99":"SINGAPORE - The National University of Singapore (NUS) has implemented new penalties, including expulsion, to ensure students comply with temperature-taking measures, in the light of the coronavirus pandemic.  The punishments increase in severity based on the number of offences, with third-time offenders facing immediate suspension of up to a month and the termination of any hostel housing agreement.  In addition, third-time offenders will go before the university+s Board of Discipline for a hearing that could end with them receiving more punishments, such as further suspension or even expulsion.  In a circular to students on Monday evening (March 23), seen by The Straits Times, NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, said: +Temperature monitoring is important because as many as 98 per cent of Covid-19 patients have a fever.+  The university requires all students to take their temperature twice daily - in the morning and afternoon, including weekends and public holidays - and to declare the readings in an online system.  They have to take a photograph of each reading with a date and time stamp, and retain the image for a week. The university will conduct spot checks.  Prof Ho said in the circular: +For the safety of our community, you must comply with the measures we have instituted. Any non-compliance will be dealt with in accordance with the NUS student disciplinary procedures.+  Non-compliance includes making a false declaration, not being able to provide photographic evidence of a temperature reading, or the proportion of temperatures declared is below 70 per cent for one week, or not even one temperature reading each day.  First time offenders will receive a warning letter, with those staying in hostels getting nine demerit points.  The Demerit Point Structure on the university+s website says if a hostelite accumulates 16 demerit points or more within one residential year, which runs from June 1 to May 31 every year, he or she will face a housing suspension of 12 months with effect from the date of the disciplinary outcome letter.  Any demerit points accumulated within a residential year, that amounts to less that 16 points, are reset to zero on June 1.

And has the Covid-19 outbreak helped in fighting climate change?  The Straits Times sat down with four experts - Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli, Public Hygiene Council chairman Edward D+Silva, the director of the National Environment Agency+s (NEA) department of public cleanliness, Mr Tai Ji Choong, and director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Wang Linfa - to find out more.  Q: What does tray return have to do with my health?  Professor Wang: Infectious materials are living organisms that thrive on food. The longer you leave contaminants on the table, the higher the chances of someone coming in contact with them.  Q: What is one of the worst hygiene habits people here have?  Mr Masagos: Until recently, even myself, after I eat in a hawker centre, I will put my tissue paper inside (my bowl) and I think that+s not littering, it+s just keeping it away from the floor and so forth. But I+m beginning to recognise that these are also what I call little biohazards that you leave on the table sometimes, or even in your bowl.  Eat on a tray so that if the food falls out of your bowl, it falls on the tray, and then when you return the tray, the table is clean for the next person. At the same time, the cleaners do not have to clean up after you.  Q: Is +I cannot find a bin+ a valid excuse for littering?  Mr Tai: Well, just counting the public bins that are owned by NEA, we already have over 11,000 bins - and this doesn+t include the town council bins.  The shopping malls have their own bins. The MRT stations have their own bins. So actually Singapore has no shortage of bins. And the bins are actually within very easy reach.  So there are really no reasons for a person to say +I cannot find a bin, so I just drop (my litter).+  Related Story Keeping clean the first line of defence against coronavirus: Expert panel  Q: What changes are being made to Singapore+s hawker centres to encourage cleaner practices?  Mr D+Silva: We realise that when customers finish their food, if you want them to clear their trays, the tray return facility should be as close as possible to them so that they don+t have to walk a long way. These are just behavioural patterns. So I think this is something which we can learn and we can improve.  The cleaning operators will have to also upskill themselves, and we need to see how we can help them mechanise to some extent, and at the same time educate and promote awareness among their own cleaners... (Cleaners) can do a much better, efficient job if they are doing things other than just clearing your trays. So I think these are little things that we can tweak in the months ahead.  Q: How do cleaning agents and disinfectants help fight the virus?  Prof Wang: The virus has a lipid membrane outside, and for the virus to remain intact, it needs to maintain the lipid.  Many of the cleaning agents can dissolve this lipid, so that+s why it+s very important that we wash our hands either with soap or a sanitiser or 70 per cent ethanol. All of these will not only clean the environment in the general sort of sense but, more specifically for Covid-19, you can actually disrupt the virus and then prevent its transmission.  Q: Can Covid-19 help lower global emissions and fight climate change?  Mr Masagos: Even if there is a positive impact on climate change, the cost to lives is huge, and I don+t think we should be celebrating this.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Related Story Five lessons from fighting Covid-19  Related Story Drill into what makes people socially responsible  We have set the world on this journey of reducing emissions and then getting ready to adapt.

R0 refers to the basic reproduction number. It indicates the natural spread of the virus, said Professor Wang, who is director of the programme in emerging infectious diseases at Duke-NUS Medical School.  If R0 is less than one, it means each existing infection causes fewer than one new infection. In this case, the disease will decline and eventually die out, but if it is greater than one, it will probably keep spreading.  Countries, including Singapore, are taking measures to drive R0 to less than one, said Prof Want.  +I think so far we+re doing pretty good, but I think we need to really keep it up,+ he said, adding that everyone, from the individual to the Government, could help to draw down R0 for Covid-19.  Prof Wang said the R0 for Covid-19 is estimated to be between two and three, similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). In comparison, the R0 for measles is about 12.  Prof Wang said bringing R0 down would also help to +flatten the epidemic curve+ by preventing the number of infected cases from surging suddenly.  The epidemic curve is an n-shaped curve that is used to visualise when new cases happen and at what speed during a virus outbreak.  Said Prof Wang: +If you let the natural R0 play out, the hospitals will collapse because there+s not enough beds, not enough ventilators. So the strategy is to flatten the curve so that, for example, you have severe cases of 10 per day rather than a hundred or a thousand per day.+  Prof Wang was one of four panellists who took part in Monday+s discussion.  The other three included Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli, who is head of the new SG Clean task force; Mr Edward D+Silva, chairman of the Public Hygiene Council; and Mr Tai Ji Choong, director of the National Environment Agency+s Department of Public Cleanliness.  While other measures - such as adhering to social distancing recommendations and staying home if one feels ill - are important, Mr Masagos said that it was also important for people to practise good cleanliness habits.  Related Story Keeping clean the first line of defence against coronavirus: Expert panel  +Public hygiene, personal hygiene is our first defence. And it+s not just our defence against Covid-19 today, but against other breakouts that we cannot foresee in future,+ he said.  Asked if travelling on public transport was safe, given the recent recommendations for people to keep their distance from others, Mr Masagos said the risk of exposure depended on a number of factors, including duration and intensity of exposure, and the density of the crowd.  Huge crowds, such as the religious gathering at a mosque in Malaysia, was one example of high-density situations that should be avoided, said Mr Masagos, who is also Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs.  +The other is intensity - how close are you to the person, how much you+re interacting with the person,+ he said, citing the cluster of Covid-19 patients who were linked to a dinner event at Safra Jurong.  Contact-tracing efforts had found that the patients linked to the event had also spent time together outside the dinner, including going for karaoke sessions together.  Duration of exposure is also important, said Mr Masagos, adding that the rough guideline is to keep exposure to under about 30 minutes.  Said Mr Masagos: +Therefore, if in any social setting, if you can ensure that you have short duration, you have low intensity and you have low density, then you are safer than not.+  Prof Wang added that in such an outbreak, there is no fail-safe measure and that there is a risk of exposure in any closed environment, including in an elevator.  However, he said: +But if you have to take public transport, the chance in Singapore of getting on a contaminated MRT, for example, is very low.+  Said Prof Wang: +But even if the hand is contaminated, you+re not going to be infected. It+s only when you rub your nose or your eyes. You just need to be cautious that when you go out in public... Then as soon as you get to the office or home, wash your hands. I think that+s the best you can do.+","102":"SINGAPORE - Residents might see their trash around for longer periods than usual, with waste collection timings being extended from 7pm now to 10pm in the days to come.  The cleaning frequency might also be reduced and certain areas might only be cleaned on alternate days, said Mr Tai Ji Choong, director of the Department of Public Cleanliness at the National Environment Agency (NEA), at a Straits Times panel discussion on Monday (March 23) on tackling the spread of Covid-19 here.  The changes in operations come as cleaning service providers here face a lack of manpower following the lockdown imposed by Malaysia earlier this month, which affected a number of cleaners in Singapore who come from across the Causeway.  Mr Tai said that the maintenance of cleanliness in critical areas such as drains - which are a source of dengue mosquito breeding - as well as the emptying of bins, will be prioritised. The same goes for areas that have very high footfall, he added.  He said: +But for all other areas, we may have to reduce our cleaning frequencies, and we ask for residents+ understanding that for certain areas that are cleaned daily, we may have to actually clean (on) alternate days.  +We ask also for residents+ understanding that the refuse may be with them for a longer time... Our workers will try their best to remove it as quickly as possible.+  Mr Tai added that Singapore+s incineration plants remain unaffected but the agency will continue to monitor other waste management services such as waste recycling.  +Our message to Singaporeans is this: Please don+t litter. Throw your litter into the bins. If everybody acted responsibly, we can still keep Singapore clean, even with the reduced manpower required to clean Singapore.+  The agency is also looking to have more areas cleaned by mechanical road sweepers, he added.  Related Story Keeping clean the first line of defence against coronavirus: Expert panel  Mr Tai also said in the panel discussion that NEA, together with the Health Ministry and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, has developed a set of interim guidelines for disinfection which owners of premises have to follow closely.  Whenever a new case of infection has been reported, the agency walks the premises+ cleaning crew through the cleaning process - including wearing proper personal protective equipment, using the right disinfectants and identifying frequently touched areas such as lift buttons, handrails, benches and table tops.  Mr Tai said the agency+s officers would figure out the things residents +have to touch in order to move around+.  +That is something that we pay attention to and the cleaning crew might not be so aware of these areas - they will just sweep the floor. But we actually raise their awareness of all these kinds of areas that they need to wipe down.+  Besides working with cleaning service providers, NEA works with households with a family member who has been infected with the coronavirus. The agency advises these families on proper disinfection procedures and assists them in disposing of items that might be contaminated, such as pillowcases and bedsheets.  Also on Monday+s panel were Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli, Professor Wang Linfa, director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Medical School, and Mr Edward D+Silva, chairman of the Public Hygiene Council.","103":"SINGAPORE - Enforcement action has been taken against 21 workplaces which have failed to comply with government advisories on safe distancing measures to reduce the risk of local transmission of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in a statement on Monday (March 23).  Thirteen stop-work orders and eight remedial orders were issued to workplaces which disregarded the need for safe distancing on Monday in the first day of enforcement, MOM said.  These orders will be in place until rectifications are made.  The inspections target workplaces with large groups of workers, such as factories, construction sites, shipyards as well as collaborative workplaces.  MOM also noted that some companies have also adopted other precautionary measures to protect workers+ well-being, such as temperature screening.  The ministry reminded all employers to place their employees on work-from-home arrangements wherever possible, especially for vulnerable employees such as older workers, pregnant workers and those with pre-existing medical conditions.  For roles which require the worker to return to the company, employers should ensure wider physical spacing of at least 1m for work stations and seats in meeting rooms, pantries, rest areas and other congregation points, MOM said.  They should also reduce duration and proximity of physical interactions, stagger working hours, defer non-critical work events and scale down critical work events, and implement or enhance shift or split team operations, MOM added in the statement.  Safe distancing measures should also be clearly communicated to all workers.  Related Story Firms urged to stagger work hours, let staff work from home  +Such measures may require businesses to adjust work processes but are necessary to suppress the spread of Covid-19 and protect our community.

MOM said that these inspections will continue and appropriate enforcement actions against non-compliant workplaces will be taken.  Meanwhile, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) issued a similar advisory on Monday to all financial institutions in Singapore, advising them to implement safe distancing measures in all aspects of their business operations, especially customer touch points.  Financial institutions were advised to encourage all customers to use electronic platforms for financial transactions, limit the number of people waiting at their premises, prioritise service to vulnerable customers as well as collect details of visitors for contact tracing purposes, MAS said.","104":"SINGAPORE - Nine in 10 imported Covid-19 cases in Singapore between Wednesday (March 18) and Friday last week did not show symptoms, like fever, when they had passed through the border checkpoints.  As a result, the cases were detected only later on, the Health Ministry said on Monday (March 23) in response to queries.  It explained that about 90 per cent of the imported cases reported in Singapore during the three-day period saw a doctor at a hospital or general practitioner+s clinic after they returned home.  +They had not displayed symptoms when at the checkpoints,+ it added.  Travellers into Singapore have to walk past thermal scanners, which would help identify those who are feverish. Those who are observed to be so, or have other respiratory symptoms will be required to do a Covid-19 swab test.  Singapore had 119 cases altogether in those three days, with 87 of them being imported cases, the ministry+s figures show.  There have been mounting concerns that people with coronavirus may not show symptoms, such as fever, dry cough and shortness of breath.  Scientists are calling for urgent studies to determine the proportion of people with coronavirus who show no, or delayed, symptoms, amid fears that the number of silent carriers may be greater than previously thought.  The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that as many as one-third of the people who test positive show delayed symptoms or none at all, citing classified data from the Chinese government.  In line with stiffer border controls to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, travellers entering Singapore, regardless of where they come from, have been given a 14-day stay-home notice since 11.59pm on Friday. It is mandatory even for those who are well.  The ministry had also said on Sunday that an additional precaution will be taken for those who come into close contact with a confirmed case on their flight back.  Related Story Coronavirus: All travellers arriving in Singapore must submit health declaration from Friday  They will be quarantined.  A quarantine order requires the person to stay put in a dedicated room with a toilet.  It is the strictest among the measures and is given to those who are, or are suspected of being, a carrier of the coronavirus.  In contrast, people serving a stay-home notice will not require a dedicated room and toilet, but they must stay home at all times.  Border control measures in Singapore will be intensified from 11.59pm on Monday (March 23) in a further effort to reduce the risk of importing coronavirus cases.  All short-term visitors, including tourists, will be barred from entering or transiting through Singapore.  Also, work-pass holders and their dependants will be allowed to return to Singapore only if they are employed in sectors that provide essential services, such as healthcare and transport.","105":"SINGAPORE - Enhanced social distancing measures were announced last Friday (March 13), gatherings are now being limited to 250 people at a time. Some people have asked if it is still safe to go swimming in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Q: Is it safe to go swimming during this period? Can the virus be transmitted through water?  A: It is known that the virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets and saliva, but there is currently no evidence suggesting that the virus can be spread through water, hence making swimming one of the safer sporting activities.  Infectious diseases expert Dr Leong Hoe Nam also suggests that it is generally safe to go swimming, as the water and chlorine within swimming pools could help to kill the virus.  People, however, should be mindful of their interactions with others outside of the water.  Professor Paul Tambyah from the department of medicine at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine noted media reports about an infection cluster in a South Korean church that sprayed saltwater in its churchgoers\u2019 mouths. However this incident does not provide clear evidence suggesting that the virus can be transmitted via water, he said.  Prof Tambyah also said that it is not known as to how long the virus can survive in plain water, and there has been no cases of viral transmission through plain water.  Thus, citing the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Prof Tambyah concludes that recreational activities in water is generally safe.  Q: What precautions should one take outside the swimming pool?  A: Individuals should practise good basic hygiene by refraining from sharing towels, and showering before entering the pool, said Prof Tambyah. He also cautions that individuals should avoid public pools when they are unwell, or if they are on a stay-at-home order.  As common facilities such as locker rooms and showers may be crowded, showering at home could be a safer precautionary measure.  Dr Leong also advised individuals to avoid lingering around the pool area, and to go home directly after swimming.  Those who need to use public shower facilities should opt for a single shower cubicle, he added  SportsSG has also regulated the number of people using the Active SG swimming pools at a single point in time, and closed off children pools until further notice.  These precautionary measures were implemented in line with the advisory issued by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on March 13, which said that sports centres with indoor facilities should limit the number of patrons and introduce physical separation measures, on top of increased cleaning frequency and issuing advisories to reduce unnecessary contact.  Related Story Coronavirus: Physical distancing measures at public sports facilities face hurdles  Q: Are lane segregation measures introduced effective against the spread of the virus?  A: Lane segregation has been implemented at running tracks and swimming pools, in line with the precautionary measures that came into force last Sunday (March 15).  This means that several running lanes are cordoned off at various stadiums, restricting runners to a few available lanes.  ActiveSG swimming pools have placed lane ropes restricting swimming to the length of the pool. Certain lanes have been allocated for swimming classes and lap swimming, while the remaining are available to the rest of the swimmers.  Experts have warned that while such social distancing measures make sense, people should still be wary of possible overcrowding situations.","106":"SINGAPORE - While the Republic continues to ramp up its fight against the coronavirus outbreak, it cannot drop its guard against its old foe, dengue, said Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli on Monday (March 23) at a panel discussion organised by The Straits Times on combating the spread of Covid-19 here.  As of Sunday, more than 4,000 people here had been infected with dengue fever, double the number of cases reported for the same period last year.  Worse still, said Mr Masagos, the strain of dengue threatening Singapore today, DENV-3, is one which many here do not have immunity against.  There are four dengue serotypes, with DENV-1 and DENV-2 being behind the outbreaks here. DENV-2 has been the dominant strain since 2016.  Mr Masagos warned: +The last time we had the DENV-3 outbreak was 30 years ago, which means that there+s a generation of us who do not have the antibodies or the immunity against (it)... it+s certainly something to cause alarm.+  He added: +We hope that as much as we are worried about Covid-19, we must not lose sight of ensuring that... we do not become lax.  +Yes, we start washing our hands - it+s fantastic, we don+t leave tissues on the table, but please continue to do the things that we have always been doing year after year to bring down and to keep suppressing the breeding of mosquitoes because that+s the only and best defence against dengue transmission.+  In response to the grim dengue outlook here, the National Environment Agency (NEA) had brought forward the launch of its annual dengue prevention campaign, which typically begins in April or May, to Sunday.  Also on Monday+s panel were Professor Wang Linfa, director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Medical School, Mr Edward D+Silva, chairman of the Public Hygiene Council, and Mr Tai Ji Choong, director of NEA+s Department of Public Cleanliness.  Prof Wang said that those who had previously been exposed to the DENV-1 and DENV-2 strains of dengue are at higher risk of getting a more severe infection from the DENV-3 strain due to a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement.  This occurs when antibodies that are already present in a person from a previous dengue infection bind to a new infectious dengue particle, but instead of neutralising the virus, help it infect the patient more efficiently.  Related Story 2 coronavirus patients test positive for dengue despite not having the mosquito-borne disease  Related Story Singapore faces dengue threat from emergence of little-seen strain  And while there is as yet no scientific evidence linking dengue and Covid-19, it is possible that a dengue infection might weaken a person+s immune system and make one more susceptible to Covid-19, said Prof Wang.  +You just want to keep healthy and avoid any infection, whether it+s dengue or Covid-19... These are two different viruses and two different approaches. But the principle is the same, it+s every citizen+s responsibility,+ he said.  Mr Masagos said: +The point is we don+t want to have two crises to fight.+  He added: +In Singapore, dengue is here to stay. Covid-19 is here but will hopefully go away. We must therefore not lose our sight on something which is also as dangerous, will also cause losses.+","107":"SINGAPORE - Singapore Airlines (SIA) has announced deeper pay cuts for management staff and compulsory no-pay leave for other employees including captains who will have to take a week off every month.  For now, there are no plans for retrenchments, The Straits Times understands.  Hours after SIA announced on Monday that it was cutting 96 per cent of its scheduled capacity till end-April and grounding 138 out of 147 SIA and SilkAir aircraft, chief executive Goh Choon Phong issued a staff circular on the latest cost-cutting moves.  In the note seen by ST, he said that SIA management will take a second round of pay cuts. Instead of 15 per cent as previously announced, Mr Goh said he will take a 30 per cent cut from April 1.  Pay cuts for other affected senior staff will range from 10 to 25 per cent. SIA board members will take a 30 per cent cut in their fees.  Mr Goh added that the airline has also reached agreement with its unions on a set of cost-cutting measures.  These include varying days of compulsory no-pay leave every month for pilots, executives and associates; as well as furlough for staff on re-employment contracts.  The measures will impact about 10,000 staff.  Before the latest measures, SIA had already rolled out a voluntary no-pay leave scheme to staff, including cabin crew.  SIA said its low-cost unit Scoot will also suspend most of its network, resulting in the grounding of 47 of its fleet of 49 aircraft.  In a release on Monday morning, SIA said that it is more vulnerable to international markets restricting the free movement of people or banning air travel because it does not have a domestic segment.  Related Story SIA is in trouble and it deserves a helping hand  Related Story Most airlines could become bankrupt before June is here  Related Story Emirates stops nearly all passenger flights, slashes wages due to coronavirus impact  +It is unclear when the SIA Group can begin to resume normal services, given the uncertainty as to when the stringent border controls will be lifted,+ it said. +The resultant collapse in the demand for air travel has led to a significant decline in SIA+s passenger revenues.+  UOB Kay Hian\u2019s K. Ajith said that SIA could potentially lose over $140 million April, and could be in a precarious position by end June without financial help from the Government.  The Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation has estimated that about half of all global airlines could disappear before the year end as casualties of Covid-19.  Many countries across the world have imposed increasingly tight border controls either on its own citizens or on foreigners visiting the country to contain the virus. Australia, for instance, said last Thursday that it is closing its borders to all visitors indefinitely.  The United States has also closed its borders with Canada and Mexico and banned inbound travellers who had been to any of more than 25 listed countries up to two weeks before their arrival. Singapore on Sunday likewise said that all short-term visitors will no longer be allowed to enter or transit through the country from 11.59pm on Monday.  In this travel-hostile environment, SIA said that it is actively taking steps to build up its liquidity, and to reduce capital expenditure and operating costs.  The measures that it is taking include discussions with aircraft manufacturers to defer upcoming aircraft deliveries and, if agreed, it will consequently defer payment for those aircraft deliveries.  In the past few days, the SIA Group has drawn on its lines of credit to meet its immediate cash flow requirements and it is in discussion with several financial institutions for its future funding requirements.  +The company continues to explore measures to shore up its liquidity during this unprecedented disruption to global air travel,+ it said, adding: +The company will release further details when such measures have been firmed up.+  Until this crisis hit, SIA was the 15th largest airline group in the world, serving around 140 destinations in more than 35 countries and territories.","108":"SINGAPORE - The first Singaporean to die from Covid-19 complications was cremated on Sunday evening (March 22) at Mandai Crematorium, according to Chinese media reports.  The 75-year-old woman, who had a history of chronic heart disease and hypertension, died in hospital at 7.52am on Saturday.  She had tested positive for the virus on Feb 23.  Known as Case 90, the woman was linked to the cluster at The Life Church and Missions Singapore.  She is the first of two Covid-19 deaths that Singapore has seen.  The second is a 64-year-old Indonesian national who had arrived in Singapore on March 13.  He was referred to as Case 212 and had pneumonia and had a history of heart disease.  According to Shin Min Daily News, the woman, whom it named as Loy Kock Eng, was cremated after a memorial service at Mandai Crematorium that was attended by about 40 family members and friends.  The coffin was handled by two funeral service workers who were wearing masks and personal protective gear.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  The National Environment Agency had in February issued a set of guidelines on the handling of the bodies of those infected with Covid-19.  The protocols stipulate that the bodies must be prepared for cremation or burial by healthcare workers in hospitals. They must also be double-bagged before they are placed in airtight coffins.  The agency has also issued guidelines to funeral directories and parlours for additional precautionary measures at funerals and wakes. These include limiting the number of attendees to below 250 and implementing social distancing.  The woman had reported the onset of symptoms on Feb 9 and sought treatment at a general practitioner+s clinic thrice before she was admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases on Feb 23.  She was confirmed to have Covid-19 the same day and had been in the intensive care unit since and developed serious complications, a Ministry of Health statement had said earlier.  Before she was admitted to hospital, the woman had kept mostly to her home in Bishan Street 12, the ministry had said.  A church friend told Shin Min that the woman had attended The Life Church and Missions Singapore for about three years, and was a reserved person who was active and practised qigong.  The woman is linked to the second-largest virus cluster in Singapore, with 33 patients and comprising two church sub-clusters. One is The Life Church and Missions Singapore, which had nine other patients, while the other is the Grace Assembly of God church, which had 23 patients.","109":"SINGAPORE - In a move to help the international community combat the coronavirus pandemic, the Government will be making the software for its contact-tracing application TraceTogether, which has already been installed by more than 620,000 people, freely available to developers around the world.  In a Facebook post on Monday (March 23), Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative Vivian Balakrishnan said that the app, developed by the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) and the Ministry of Health, will be open-sourced.  This means that the software+s source code will be made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.  +We believe that making our code available to the world will enhance trust and collaboration in dealing with a global threat that does not respect boundaries, political systems or economies,+ said Dr Balakrishnan, who is also Foreign Minister.  +Together, we can make our world safer for everyone.+  Launched last Friday, the TraceTogether app can identify people who have been within 2m of coronavirus patients for at least 30 minutes, using wireless Bluetooth technology. Its developers say the app is useful when those infected cannot recall whom they had been in close proximity with for an extended duration.  For the app to start tracing, the Bluetooth setting on mobile phones has to be turned on.  If a user gets infected, the authorities will be able to quickly find out the other users he has been in close contact with, allowing for easier identification of potential cases and helping curb the spread of the virus.  Official contact tracers will provide a code that users can match with a corresponding verification code on their app. Once authenticated, users will get a PIN that allows data to be submitted.  Contact tracers will not ask for any personal financial details or request that money be transferred over the phone.  In his post on Monday, Dr Balakrishnan said that the GovTech team was working +around the clock+ to finalise documents to allow others to use the BlueTrace protocol - the building blocks of the TraceTogether app. He added that TraceTogether has been installed by more than 620,000 users so far.

Some are serving a 14-day leave of absence after returning from trips abroad during the holidays, as part of stricter measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus announced by the Ministry of Education (MOE) last week.  The leave of absence would apply to students and staff of schools, pre-schools and student care centres who returned from overseas on or after March 14, MOE had said.  Students who have to miss classes will be supported through home-based learning programmes.  The Straits Times has contacted the ministry for more information.  Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said in a Facebook post on Monday afternoon that additional safe distancing measures are in place in schools, after visiting a few of them in the morning.  These include exam-style seating for pupils from Primary 3; fixed group-cluster seating for Primary 1, Primary 2 and MOE kindergarten children; wipe-down routines; and assigned seating in canteens and play areas.  +Schools seemed a bit quieter with some students serving their leave of absence or stay-home notice,+ said Mr Ong. +But they all took the precautionary measures in their stride. They understand that the measures are necessary to keep them safe.+  He added: +We are doing our best to keep students and staff safe in school so that students can continue learning in a familiar environment, with a familiar routine. Let us all do our part to make that happen.+  Many parents have recently voiced their concerns, with some asking why the holidays were not extended, prompting Mr Ong to address such issues in an earlier post on Facebook on Sunday.  The minister cited scientific evidence, the extra precautions and a desire to reduce disruptions as key considerations in allowing students to resume classes.  On Monday, some parents made efforts to avoid the morning crowds, while others said they hoped the ministry would give students a home-based learning option, given the evolving situation.  Housewife Joanna Tan, 40, said she usually takes a public bus with her seven-year-old daughter to Paya Lebar Methodist Girls+ School (Primary). But they left the house 10 minutes earlier on Monday morning to catch a less crowded bus, and arrived at the school at 7am.  +After school, we also walked one bus stop up so we wouldn+t have to wait with the crowds.+  Madam Priscilla Yeow, 44, said her Secondary 2 son and Primary 6 daughter also went to school on Monday.  +We+re definitely worried and the situation around the world is very bad. But I think our Government has implemented good border controls and schools are taking a lot of precautions, like suspending co-curricular activities,+ she said.

But the spike in the number of imported cases last week made some parents like Madam Diana Ismail decide to keep their children at home instead.  The 41-year-old business owner+s four sons will stay at home this week while she monitors the situation. One of them is in pre-school, another in primary school and the oldest two are in secondary school.  +My concern is that some parents had gone abroad and are now on stay-home notice, but their children can still go to school if they didn+t travel,+ she said.  Madam Diana added: +My sons are in four different schools and they have to take public transport, so I just want to minimise any possible contact with more people... My mum, who lives with us, is in her 60s and not in good health, so I have to take care of her too.+  Perhaps the March school break could have been extended by a week or two, and the June holidays could be used for lessons to make up for the curriculum time lost, she suggested.  +Wouldn+t it be simpler for everyone to have e-learning, and maybe employers could allow parents to take turns to work from home in this pandemic?+    Pei Chun Public School pupils queueing up in their school+s canteen.

The move is aimed at freeing up capacity at public hospitals so they can take care of the more seriously ill Covid-19 patients.  The transferred patients were ones who were no longer sick, or needed less medical care, but were still shedding the virus.  They will be discharged once they are confirmed to be clear of the virus and no longer risk spreading the disease.  Mount Elizabeth Hospital is the first of four Parkway hospitals to take in Covid-19 patients from the public sector, said Dr Noel Yeo, senior vice-president of Parkway\u2019s hospital operations in Singapore.  The number of new infections here, especially imported ones, has been fairly high as residents return from high-infection countries.  There are now more than 300 Covid-19 patients hospitalised here.  The Health Ministry said that it expected the number of Covid-19 cases in Singapore to increase, and had plans in place to deal with increased demand for hospital and clinical services.  It has activated a collaboration between public and private hospitals to transfer well and stable Covid-19 patients to selected private hospitals so that capacity in the public sector may be freed for the management of more severe cases.  Over the past three days, the National Centre for Infectious Diseases had transferred 20 patients to Concord International Hospital, in addition to 29 patients to Mount Elizabeth Hospital, via dedicated ambulances, it said in a statement on Monday.  Obstetricians at Parkway East had expressed concerns that the ward for the Covid-19 patients is on the same floor as the maternity ward.  However, Dr Yeo said: \u201cThe same stringent safety protocols and precautionary measures will apply for these new patients, who will be housed in a single ward at the hospital.\u201d  Related Story SGH sets up fever screening area in carpark as cases spike  These patients will not be allowed to leave the ward, nor allowed any visitors. All staff working in areas where the patients are must don protective apparel.  He added that the areas these patients had passed through during the transfer will be thoroughly cleaned and sanitised.  Dr Yeo said: \u201cWe have been working closely with the Ministry of Health on joining the national effort against Covid-19, and how private sector resources may be utilised to alleviate the load on public healthcare institutions.\u201d  He hopes other private sector hospitals will also \u201cplay their part to complement these efforts\u201d.  Last week, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said Singapore has sufficient healthcare facilities and workers to cope with the current number of Covid-19 patients.  He said there are also contingency plans if numbers go up.  These include opening up more wards in public hospitals as well as using quarantine facilities for recovering patients.  MOH said on Monday that there are plans to further collaborate with private hospitals to manage Covid-19 cases, as well as patients with other conditions, to free up capacity in the public sector.","112":"SINGAPORE - All travellers arriving in Singapore - including Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders - must submit an online health declaration before proceeding with immigration clearance, from Friday 9am (March 27).  The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said on Monday that all travellers will have to do so via the SG Arrival Card electronic service.  ICA explained that this new entry requirement is an additional precautionary measure to mitigate the risk of importing Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, into Singapore. It will be subject to further review according to the global Covid-19 situation.  The data from the declarations will be used by the Ministry of Health (MOH) for contact tracing purposes if any traveller becomes a suspected or confirmed coronavirus case. The data will also become part of the traveller\u2019s medical history for reference at local healthcare institutions where these travellers will be treated.  Long-term pass holders refer to those with a student\u2019s pass, dependant\u2019s pass, work pass or long-term visit pass.  ICA+s announcement comes after MOH said on Sunday that all short-term visitors from anywhere in the world will not be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore from Monday, 11.59pm.  The Ministry of Manpower will only allow the entry or return of work-pass holders, including their dependants, who provide essential services, such as in healthcare and transport.  ICA said on Monday that those who do not submit their electronic health declarations before arriving here must fill in and submit their forms electronically before they can proceed with immigration clearance. This will unnecessarily delay their immigration clearance, the authority added.  Travellers who provide false declarations can be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act.  The new health declaration function on the SG Arrival Card e-service was developed by ICA in consultation with MOH, and is fully integrated with ICA\u2019s immigration system.  The e-service was rolled out for testing from August last year to allow short-term visitors to submit information about their visit to Singapore digitally before they arrived here.  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore residents who travel overseas may face consequences as Govt ramps up border controls  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  This was to replace the need to fill up paper-based disembarkation\/embarkation cards. ICA said that as of last month, it had cleared more than 560,000 electronic SG Arrival Card records that short-term visitors had submitted.  Singapore residents and long-term pass holders submitting their health declaration will need to select \u201cResidents\u201d on the e-service. They will then be directed to provide their health and recent travel information, as well as personal and contact details.  The health declaration will be made available before Friday as part of the SG Arrival Card e-Service, so that travellers who are due to arrive in Singapore after Friday 9am can complete it before their arrival.  Travellers can submit their health declarations up to three days before arriving here. They must re-submit their health declaration if there are changes to their health conditions or travel histories before arriving in Singapore.  The SG Arrival Card e-service is available at ICA\u2019s website and the service\u2019s free mobile application can be downloaded from the Apple App Store and Google Play store.  ICA added that from Friday 9am, it will end the paper-based disembarkation\/embarkation card.  This means that when entry into Singapore for short-term visitors resumes in the future, these travellers must provide their arrival and departure information through the SG Arrival Card e-service instead.","113":"SINGAPORE - Taxi drivers displaced by the developing coronavirus outbreak will be deployed to lessen crowding on trains, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said on Monday (March 23).  Speaking during a visit to Bright Hill station on Stage 2 of the Thomson-East Coast line (TEL), Mr Khaw said having +temporary transport ambassadors to help commuters keep safe distances+ was an idea mooted by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean.  +These are temporary positions to support higher manpower needs at our stations during this special period,+ Mr Khaw said. +These ambassadors can also help to sanitise our train cabins, seats, poles more frequently.+  During pre-outbreak times, MRT trains could pack as many as four commuters per square metre during peak hours. Although crowding has reduced since the coronavirus forced many to work from home, public transport commuters are still placed well within the 1m distance recommended by the Government for entertainment venues, restaurants, hawker centres and cinemas.  Mr Khaw said: +I would very much like to do the same for buses and trains. Unfortunately, as public transport has to accommodate large numbers of people at the same time, this is very challenging. Almost impossible, unless we can substantially reduce peak-hour demand. I say: Let+s try.+  He said the transport ambassadors could be employed on three or six-month contracts, +depending on how long the pandemic lasts+.  Cabbies who have seen their earnings hit by the Covid-19 pandemic can fill these roles. +The extra cash allowance may also come in handy... to supplement their reduced income,+ Mr Khaw said. He noted that transport operators have seen some of their taxi drivers suffering due to reduced income.  +They are keen to try out the transport ambassador idea, for their taxi drivers,+ the minister said, adding that the Land Transport Authority will work with them to get the scheme running +in the coming weeks+.  +This is our attempt to help one another, within the public transport sector, cope with the pandemic,+ he said. +Regulator, transport operators and unions working together, fighting a common enemy. We will emerge stronger as one transport family.+  He also suggested that displaced cabbies can train to be bus captains.  Taxi drivers and private-hire drivers say their earnings have dropped by as much as 60 per cent since the outbreak hit Singapore in January. Many have given up driving as a result, despite financial aid handed out by the Government and operators.  While no operator would divulge its unhired rate, industry observers reckon it could be as high as 30 per cent. If so, more than 20,000 drivers have given up their vehicles.","114":"SINGAPORE - Stage 2 of the Thomson-East Coast line (TEL) is likely to open after July.  Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said on Monday (March 23) that testing of the six-station stretch will be carried out from April to July.  Speaking during a visit to the Bright Hill MRT station, Mr Khaw said Stage 1 will close early and open later on weekends from April to July. This is to facilitate testing of Stage 2, which comprises six stations - Springleaf, Lentor, Mayflower, Bright Hill, Upper Thomson and Caldecott.  +This will allow us to run trains through the entire stretch of nine stations, from Woodlands North to Caldecott for thorough integrated testing. It is necessary,+ he said.  +We did the same for the Downtown Line, which also opened in stages,+ he added.  In a separate statement, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and SMRT said services on Stage 1 of the TEL - Woodlands North, Woodlands and Woodlands South stations - will close earlier, at 10pm every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and start later at 6.30am every Saturday and Sunday, from April 3 to July 26.  TEL Stage 2 will benefit more than 60,000 households near the six new stations.  The minister also said more needs to be done to reduce crowding on public transport in light of the developing Covid-19 pandemic.  He outlined a few steps: One, do not use public transport if you are unwell, as doing so will endanger other commuters. Two, cut down on unnecessary travels during this period. Three, talk softly, if you need to.  +Best, don+t talk,+ he said. +Let fellow commuters have a quiet journey.+  Talking increases the chance of droplets - a key means of transmission - being dispersed.

Jokes aside, the 7 minute 45 second video, posted in Mandarin with English subtitles, has a serious purpose as it debunks some of the misinformation circulating around the outbreak. In the clip, children share tips on how to wash hands correctly, wear a mask and the proper etiquette in sneezing or coughing. The 2 minute 19 second clip was uploaded on to American news site abc30 on Thursday. What transpires is Bengali Aunty singing +Wash your hands, wash your hands\/ Clean out every pore\/ The deadly Coronavirus\/Is knocking at your door,+ in a musical video that almost verges on the surreal.","80":"SINGAPORE - Insead dean Ilian Mihov has contracted the Covid-19 coronavirus, the business school said on Sunday (March 15).

Posting the second-strongest February sales performance in eight years, developers moved 975 private homes \u2013 up 57.3 per cent from the 620 units they sold the month before, driven by competitively-priced new projects. The latest figure is also 114 per cent higher than the 455 units developers sold in February last year. (That) will certainly dampen housing demand,\u201d Ms Tricia Song, head of research for Singapore, Colliers International, said. Other top sellers included existing projects such as Treasure at Tampines (97 units), Parc Esta (53 units), Jadescape (46 units) and Parc Botannia (40 units).","84":"Wedding bells will not be ringing yet for Ase Wang.

Wang+s planned wedding celebrations in the Maldives will also be postponed in the light of the situation.","85":"The Panguni Uthiram chariot and foot procession, which is part of the annual Panguni Uthiram festival, will be cancelled this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The festival, slated for April 6, is celebrated by Hindus and held in honour of the Hindu god Murugan. The committee had discussed alternative options but found it +difficult to organise a scaled-down procession+, said temple chairman Narainasamy in a statement yesterday. Every year, the Panguni Uthiram chariot and foot procession draws 10,000 to 15,000 devotees who gather in close proximity to one another, both along the procession route and in the temple. The committee will also limit to 250 the number of devotees in the temple at any given time.","86":"That+s the approach the Singapore Government is taking on the coronavirus, said Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan. Minister: I think when you are dealing with an epidemic of a new virus, you are never complacent about it. For both China and Singapore, we may have handled the first phase reasonably well, but we will not be complacent. You are, as Foreign Minister, Singapore+s face to the world, with regard to how the island is handling this crisis. My main point I am leaving with you today is - be prepared for the long haul and be organised.","87":"SINGAPORE - National carrier Singapore Airlines (SIA) is waiving all rebooking fees for tickets issued on or before Sunday (March 15), for travel up to May 31.

SportSG chief executive officer Lim Teck Yin noted that actions such as physical distancing, wiping sports equipment down after use and refraining from visiting the premises while ill are ways that Singaporeans can do their part. Regulating the number of people at our facilities helps to increase personal space and allows one to adopt physical distancing,+ he added. Children+s pools at ActiveSG swimming complexes will be closed until further notice, with temperature taking and visitor registration taking place at all pools.

All employers and employment agencies planning for their foreign domestic workers to enter Singapore will also need to obtain the MOM+s approval before the workers commence their journey. It said all new incoming foreign domestic workers must serve their stay-home notices at an alternative accommodation (dormitories, hostels or hotels) before they can be deployed for employment. For domestic workers returning from overseas, their employers can arrange for them to serve the notice in the employer+s residential address, or alternative accommodation. The applicant - either the employer or the employment agency - will be responsible for ensuring that the domestic worker complies with the stay-home notice.","92":"SINGAPORE - Singaporeans and Malaysians travelling into Singapore from Malaysia via sea or land will be exempted from the new border restrictions on Asean countries, due to the close proximity and high inter-dependency between the two neighbours. But separate arrangements for precautions are being worked out by a bilateral joint working group, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said on Sunday (March 15). He noted that 300,000 people move across the land crossings at the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints alone on a daily basis. +So for now, the arrangements which I just described will not apply to our sea and land crossings with Malaysia.+ +We want precautions to be taken there, and so separate arrangements are being worked out by the bilateral joint working group we have with Malaysia.+","93":"SINGAPORE - It was business as usual for MP Henry Kwek this weekend, even as his Kebun Baru ward has been carved out as a single-member constituency in the coming general election. The carving out of Kebun Baru from the five-member Nee Soon GRC will take 22,413 voters with it. The latest Registers of Electors as on April 15 last year lists 142,731 eligible voters in the GRC.

All affected customers will be notified progressively and will receive a Scoot travel voucher on the unused portion of their itinerary within 30 business days. It said that beyond the suspended routes, it is also making frequency adjustments on other routes and will notify affected customers directly. Prof Theseira said: +The steady diet of news about Covid-19 spreading, border restrictions, and such has greatly dampened demand. +So regardless of our border restrictions, demand for discretionary travel has collapsed globally.+","98":"SINGAPORE - Singapore Airlines (SIA) has announced deeper pay cuts for management staff and compulsory no-pay leave for other employees including captains who will have to take a week off every month. In the note seen by ST, he said that SIA management will take a second round of pay cuts. These include varying days of compulsory no-pay leave every month for pilots, executives and associates; as well as furlough for staff on re-employment contracts.

In the past few days, the SIA Group has drawn on its lines of credit to meet its immediate cash flow requirements and it is in discussion with several financial institutions for its future funding requirements.","99":"SINGAPORE - The National University of Singapore (NUS) has implemented new penalties, including expulsion, to ensure students comply with temperature-taking measures, in the light of the coronavirus pandemic. First time offenders will receive a warning letter, with those staying in hostels getting nine demerit points.

Mr Tai added that Singapore+s incineration plants remain unaffected but the agency will continue to monitor other waste management services such as waste recycling. If everybody acted responsibly, we can still keep Singapore clean, even with the reduced manpower required to clean Singapore.+ Mr Tai said the agency+s officers would figure out the things residents +have to touch in order to move around+. Besides working with cleaning service providers, NEA works with households with a family member who has been infected with the coronavirus.","103":"SINGAPORE - Enforcement action has been taken against 21 workplaces which have failed to comply with government advisories on safe distancing measures to reduce the risk of local transmission of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in a statement on Monday (March 23). Thirteen stop-work orders and eight remedial orders were issued to workplaces which disregarded the need for safe distancing on Monday in the first day of enforcement, MOM said. The inspections target workplaces with large groups of workers, such as factories, construction sites, shipyards as well as collaborative workplaces.

A: Lane segregation has been implemented at running tracks and swimming pools, in line with the precautionary measures that came into force last Sunday (March 15). ActiveSG swimming pools have placed lane ropes restricting swimming to the length of the pool. Certain lanes have been allocated for swimming classes and lap swimming, while the remaining are available to the rest of the swimmers.","106":"Worse still, said Mr Masagos, the strain of dengue threatening Singapore today, DENV-3, is one which many here do not have immunity against. This occurs when antibodies that are already present in a person from a previous dengue infection bind to a new infectious dengue particle, but instead of neutralising the virus, help it infect the patient more efficiently. +You just want to keep healthy and avoid any infection, whether it+s dengue or Covid-19... Mr Masagos said: +The point is we don+t want to have two crises to fight.+ He added: +In Singapore, dengue is here to stay.","107":"SINGAPORE - Singapore Airlines (SIA) has announced deeper pay cuts for management staff and compulsory no-pay leave for other employees including captains who will have to take a week off every month.

Unfortunately, as public transport has to accommodate large numbers of people at the same time, this is very challenging. He noted that transport operators have seen some of their taxi drivers suffering due to reduced income. Taxi drivers and private-hire drivers say their earnings have dropped by as much as 60 per cent since the outbreak hit Singapore in January.","114":"SINGAPORE - Stage 2 of the Thomson-East Coast line (TEL) is likely to open after July.
