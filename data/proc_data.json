The MOM said companies should adopt flexible work arrangements to allow these employees to work from home during that whole 14-day period. Those who are self-employed and who have to put themselves on LOA will similarly be allowed to claim this daily support. Eligible employers will be able to apply for daily support for each affected employee after their LOA is completed. Additionally, those who have been placed on stay-home notice upon returning to Singapore and whose travel was not between March 14 to 20 are not eligible for daily support under this programme.","2":"SINGAPORE - Singapore saw fewer job vacancies overall last year but there were still many opportunities in growth sectors, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on Friday (March 20). The report showed that despite economic uncertainties, like the United States-China trade war, that resulted in fewer job vacancies, employers were still creating new jobs through business expansion and formation. For PMET vacancies, employers valued candidates+ skills, work experience, and attitude over academic qualifications for about half (46 per cent) of the vacancies. The lack of necessary specialised skills was the top challenge faced by employers trying to fill PMET vacancies, said MOM. Some 19 per cent of PMET vacancies were unfilled for at least six months, compared with 41 per cent of non-PMET vacancies.","3":"Q What is a quarantine order? A A quarantine order is the strictest among the measures and is issued to those who are, or are suspected of being, a carrier of Covid-19. Quarantine usually occurs in the home, but can also be served in dedicated government quarantine facilities or hospitals. Those under quarantine will be isolated from others, and should monitor their temperatures and report their health status to their quarantine order agent at least three times a day. If those under a stay-home notice become unwell, they should avoid contact with family members and seek medical attention immediately.","4":"SINGAPORE - All regular worship services and gatherings in Anglican parish churches islandwide have been suspended until April 3. The Anglican Diocese of Singapore said on Thursday (March 19) that this was with immediate effect to +create a two-week break in church gatherings+. There are currently 27 parishes of varying sizes in the Anglican Diocese of Singapore, with an average weekly attendance of about 21,000. In the meantime, online weekend services will be conducted, and pastoral care will given to the elderly and the vulnerable.

Also on Wednesday, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said most wholesalers and retailers received their goods from Malaysia as usual in the morning.","1":"SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Manpower has urged companies to impose a leave of absence (LOA) on employees who returned from overseas between March 14 and 20, before a mandatory stay-home requirement for all those entering Singapore kicks in.  Employers who place their staff on this voluntary LOA will be able to claim daily support under a programme by the MOM aimed at alleviating the companies+ financial burden during the Covid-19 outbreak.  This initiative follows recent, stricter measures imposed by schools to curb the spread of the coronavirus, after more infections and a surge in imported cases were recorded in Singapore.  All students and staff who returned from overseas between last Saturday (March 14) and this Friday will be put on a mandatory 14-day leave of absence from the date of return.  From 11.59pm on Friday, all arriving travellers, including Singaporeans, will face even more stringent measures and will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice.  This means they will not be able to leave their homes for 14 days.  In encouraging companies to voluntarily impose the LOA on Friday, the MOM said: +The Government recognises that many parents have been affected by this national measure due to the need to provide care for their children during this period.  +At the same time, it is a useful precautionary measure for people who have travelled recently to stay away from the workplace to prevent further transmission.+  The MOM said companies should adopt flexible work arrangements to allow these employees to work from home during that whole 14-day period.  It noted that some companies had already voluntarily asked employees to stay home after returning from trips overseas between last Saturday and Friday.  Such companies should continue with existing flexible work and leave arrangements, including asking their employees to use their annual leave to cover the company imposed LOA, said the MOM.  However, for those companies that have not put such measures in place, +employers are encouraged to provide additional paid leave to the employees, if work from home is not feasible+, considering that the LOA option was not known before their employees travelled.  To help these companies, the MOM will allow them to apply for the $100 daily support under the LOA support programme, which covers only employees who are Singaporeans, permanent residents or work pass holders.  Companies can also claim a levy waiver for their affected work pass holders.  Those who are self-employed and who have to put themselves on LOA will similarly be allowed to claim this daily support.  Eligible employers will be able to apply for daily support for each affected employee after their LOA is completed.  However, employers, self-employed Singaporeans and permanent residents will not be able to claim under the support programme if they worked remotely during the LOA period or if the affected employee had to use his or her own annual leave, childcare leave or any other kind of leave to cover the LOA.  Additionally, those who have been placed on stay-home notice upon returning to Singapore and whose travel was not between March 14 to 20 are not eligible for daily support under this programme.  Said the MOM: +As the Covid-19 situation continues to evolve, there may be additional requirements imposed on work pass holders from time to time.+  It urged employers and employees to check the MOM website for the latest advisories.  LISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST","2":"SINGAPORE - Singapore saw fewer job vacancies overall last year but there were still many opportunities in growth sectors, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on Friday (March 20). Going forward, however, the uncertainties this year amid the coronavirus outbreak mean vacancies are likely to fall further, she said.  +Hiring sentiments have weakened which means job seekers will have a more challenging time,+ said Mrs Teo in a Facebook post on the Ministry of Manpower+s report on job vacancies in 2019, released on Friday.  The report showed that despite economic uncertainties, like the United States-China trade war, that resulted in fewer job vacancies, employers were still creating new jobs through business expansion and formation.  A total of 42 per cent of the 52,900 openings available last September were newly created positions from business expansion or formation. The proportion was the same as in the previous year, though the number of openings was lower than the 63,300 available in September 2018.  For this year, Mrs Teo said: +The focus must be to help as many people as possible stay in their current jobs. We can then direct job matching support to those who need it most.  +This is similar to our approach in handling the public health crisis - keep most people away from hospitals, so healthcare workers have the capacity to focus on treating those who have more serious conditions,+ she said.  This is why the $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package announced last month had a strong focus on saving jobs and protecting workers, and any further boost will do likewise, as Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has said, she added.  Mrs Teo added: +This is a tough time. MOM is here to help. Our lines are sometimes overwhelmed, as are our officers. I seek your kind patience as we try our best to respond to everyone who has reached out.+  The MOM report, which is based on a survey of about 15,300 private and public sector organisations, said that the top industries with with high proportions of new positions among vacancies last year were construction, information and communications technology (ICT), and security and investigation.  Other sectors identified by the Government as growth sectors - professional services, financial and insurance services, wholesale trade and healthcare - also saw above average proportions of vacancies for newly created positions.  Among jobs for professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs), the most sought after workers last year were software, Web and multimedia developers; teaching and training professionals and systems analysts.  Related Story More job training support for four sectors hit hardest by Covid-19  Related Story Logistics and supply chain workers can tap new retraining programme for better job prospects  Related Story Fewer job vacancies last year as employers turned cautious: MOM  For non-PMET workers, the top number of openings were for security guards; receptionists, customer service and information clerks; and shop sales assistants.  Skilled workers were increasingly in demand, with the share of vacancies for PMETs rising to 58 per cent last year, up from 53 per cent the previous year.  The proportion has been on the rise since 2013, and MOM said this reflects a growing share of vacancies coming from industries dominated by PMETs, such as public administration and education, ICT, and health and social services.  For PMET vacancies, employers valued candidates+ skills, work experience, and attitude over academic qualifications for about half (46 per cent) of the vacancies.  +This underscores the need for job seekers to reskill and upskill to stay relevant to changing job requirements,+ said MOM in the report.  Mrs Teo also highlighted the jobs-skills mismatch in her post as a longer-term issue that still needs to be tackled.  While business is down, the Government wants to work with employers to reskill and upskill their workers to prepare them for new job opportunities when the economy recovers, she said.  +That may be a long way off, but it+s still a good way to make something out of a very bad situation.+  The lack of necessary specialised skills was the top challenge faced by employers trying to fill PMET vacancies, said MOM. It was cited by employers for four in 10 of the PMET vacancies they had trouble hiring locals for.  Related Story Job-search struggles of vulnerable PMETs aged over 40  Related Story Employment security among top concerns of job seekers: Poll  Other top reasons were candidates lacking necessary work experience, and finding the pay unattractive.  For non-PMET positions which were hard to fill with locals, the top three reasons were candidates finding the pay unattractive, finding the job physically strenuous, or preferring not to do shift work.  In general, PMET openings were easier to fill than non-PMET ones. Some 19 per cent of PMET vacancies were unfilled for at least six months, compared with 41 per cent of non-PMET vacancies.  The overall share of vacancies which remained unfilled for at least six months also fell to 28 per cent last year, the lowest in at least a decade.  National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay said in a Facebook post on Friday that there could still be job opportunities such as in sectors and firms affected by labour supply disruptions.  He said that NTUC is exploring ways to better match people who are unemployed or who have been placed on reduced work hours to such opportunities.  \u201cIt may require some of us to pick up some new skills or require us to make some difficult adjustments but we should hold fast and steady and tide through this difficult period together,\u201d he said.","3":"Q What is a quarantine order?  A A quarantine order is the strictest among the measures and is issued to those who are, or are suspected of being, a carrier of Covid-19.  This means the person has either been tested positive for the virus or has exhibited symptoms after returning from an affected country. They could also have come into close contact with a confirmed patient.  Quarantine usually occurs in the home, but can also be served in dedicated government quarantine facilities or hospitals.  Those under quarantine will be isolated from others, and should monitor their temperatures and report their health status to their quarantine order agent at least three times a day.  For those serving out orders at home, spot checks will be carried out by officers. If found to be non-compliant, they may be required to wear an electronic tag or be detained and isolated in a hospital.  Q What is the penalty for breaching a quarantine order?  A As it is a legal order issued under the Infectious Diseases Act, anyone flouting a quarantine for the first time may be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both, with higher penalties for subsequent breaches.  Q What is a stay-home notice?  A From 11.59pm today, this will apply to all Singapore residents returning to the country for 14 days.  People served the notice will not require a dedicated room and toilet, unlike those under quarantine orders, but they should remain in their place of residence at all times. This means they should not go out even to purchase daily necessities. They should also not invite visitors to their residence.  Their family members may continue to live with them. However, they should observe good personal hygiene practices. If those under a stay-home notice become unwell, they should avoid contact with family members and seek medical attention immediately.  Q What is the penalty for breaching a stay-home notice?  A Singaporeans who breach the notice can be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act. First-time offenders can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both.  Permanent residents and pass holders can have their permits or passes revoked or validity shortened. Students who breach their stay-home notices can also face disciplinary action, including suspension or dismissal.  Q What is leave of absence?  A People on this are advised to stay in their place of residence for 14 days but, unlike those on stay-home notices, can leave to purchase daily necessities or to attend to important personal matters.","4":"SINGAPORE - All regular worship services and gatherings in Anglican parish churches islandwide have been suspended until April 3.  The Anglican Diocese of Singapore said on Thursday (March 19) that this was with immediate effect to +create a two-week break in church gatherings+.  +The Diocesan leadership has closely monitored the escalating Covid-19 situation and makes this contribution towards the concerted national effort to +flatten the coronavirus curve+,+ it said, referring to the graph that shows a lower number of infected cases over time with proper containment measures.  There are currently 27 parishes of varying sizes in the Anglican Diocese of Singapore, with an average weekly attendance of about 21,000.  The churches plan to be open before the weekend of April 4 and 5, the start of Holy Week, which is the week leading up to Easter Sunday on April 12.  In the meantime, online weekend services will be conducted, and pastoral care will given to the elderly and the vulnerable.  The announcement comes after St Andrew+s Cathedral, the oldest Anglican site of worship in Singapore, was closed after one of its members was infected with the coronavirus.  On Wednesday, a notice was put up informing members that the church, located next to City Hall, would be closed from 11.59pm on Wednesday to 11.59pm on April 3 for the affected premises to be professionally disinfected.  It said that it received the information about the case on Wednesday afternoon, and the infected member is currently warded in hospital.  The man had attended the 9am English service held in the Cathedral New Sanctuary on Sunday.  +He had no symptoms of illness and passed the pre-service precautionary screening comprising the health and travel declaration and temperature checks,+ the cathedral+s Covid-19 management team said in the notice.  It also encouraged members to comply with the Ministry of Health (MOH) for contact tracing and seek verification from MOH on the authenticity of calls.  The authorities announced 32 new cases on Thursday, bringing the total number of infected patients here now to 345.  Of these, 159 are imported cases and the remaining 186 cases are locally transmitted cases.","5":"SINGAPORE - With the number of Covid-19 patients rising in the past week and going up by double digits in recent days, a carpark at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) will be used to screen patients for fever, to help alleviate the load.  On Friday (March 20), the hospital will extend its fever screening area by converting part of its multistorey carpark H for the purpose.  It will be manned by staff from all six of the hospital+s medical divisions, as well as the nursing and allied health departments.  The move was announced on Thursday in an internal note to staff seen by The Straits Times and confirmed by an SGH spokesman.  Signed off by SGH chief executive officer Kenneth Kwek and medical board chairman Ruban Poopalalingam, the note said that the new screening area will help to manage the growing number of patients infected with the coronavirus nationally.  On Thursday, Singapore recorded 32 new cases. This was slightly lower than the 47 cases recorded the day before, the highest daily number since the start of the outbreak.  Singapore now has a total of 345 cases.  On Monday, the National Centre for Infectious Diseases saw unusually long queues, with people seeking Covid-19 testing without appointments or prior consultation at a clinic.  In the letter, Professor Kwek and Associate Professor Ruban said: +You would have read about the spike in the number of new Covid-19 cases in Singapore, setting a new high every day. This is a situation that we have anticipated and have been planning to meet the increased need for care.  +We are able to manage the surge because of all your efforts. Many of you have stretched yourselves physically, mentally, emotionally and psychologically and we are deeply grateful for everything you have done,+ they added.  As confirmed cases of Covid-19 exceed 200,000 around the world, hospitals have braced themselves for the surge.  Hospitals in Singapore have also been preparing for a rise in the number of cases, with Singapore seeing more imported cases in recent days.  Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said on Wednesday that the aim is to reduce the total number of cases on any day, so that the healthcare system can cope with the load.  At SGH, clinicians from other specialities have also joined in the effort to treat Covid-19 patients, lending their expertise to those in the Infectious Diseases and Emergency Medicine departments, said Profs Kwek and Ruban.

Here is what families should do when picking up anyone returning home, according to two infectious diseases experts.  PREPARATIONS  Dr Piotr Chlebicki, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Alvernia Hospital, said his daughter would be flying back on Friday from Sydney, where she is a student at the University of New South Wales.  He said it is important for parents to speak with their children before they board their flights to make sure they are asymptomatic.  +If they have symptoms like cough, fever or sore throat, they should not be flying. They should be considerate to other passengers,+ said Dr Chlebicki.  Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam said that people can be asymptomatic for two weeks, so anyone returning from abroad should be isolated for that duration.  Families must prepare a separate room, ideally with an attached bathroom, for the person, he said.  It would also be helpful to cordon off the area outside the person+s room, or any shared toilet, with tape, so that it would be a visual reminder, he added.  PICK-UP AT THE AIRPORT  Dr Leong, who practises at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said the person arriving should wear a mask and sit alone in the back seat of the car or taxi.  Windows should be down, and the air-conditioning in the vehicle switched off, he said.  The person should avoid any direct contact like hugging or kissing, and handle his own luggage.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  ARRIVAL AT HOME  Dr Leong said the person must go straight to his room once he reaches his home, and avoid touching any surfaces such as doorknobs or handles.  He should wipe down his luggage in his own room, either with water or disinfectant, he added.  +Clothes should be soaked in a pail of water for at least five to 10 minutes before being placed in a washing machine.+  INTERACTING WITH FAMILY  Dr Leong said: +The general rule is that he should keep a physical distance of more than 2m apart at all times.  +A family member needs to prepare food and water and place it outside his room, and he can come out and bring it into his room.+  However, Dr Chlebicki said that if the person is asymptomatic, the risk of getting infected by them is low, so there may not be a need for total separation.  The person can come out to get a drink of water, for example.  Related Story Coronavirus: How to quarantine yourself  +If they cough, they could generate a droplet (that could infect others). So, it is possible to be contagious before you display symptoms.  +But asymptomatic people are inefficient in transmitting the virus because they have a smaller amount of it, compared to symptomatic people. I think there should be a risk-benefit balance - the risk of getting the virus from an asymptomatic person is low and the benefit of having your child at home is high.+  But the person should still spend the bulk of the time in a separate room, he said, and family members should also observe basic hygiene such as frequent hand-washing.  Dr Leong said that if the person is using a shared bathroom, more precautions should be taken because the virus can be transmitted via surfaces. +He must wipe down what he touches before and after use, and close the (toilet) lid when flushing. The family members must also do the same.+  Similarly, all +high-touch+ areas in the home, such as door handles, doorknobs, taps and sinks must be cleaned frequently, he added.

According to the Ministry of Health+s website, people who have recently travelled overseas, and are feeling unwell with a fever or respiratory symptoms like a cough or runny nose, should go to any of the Public Health Preparedness Clinics, or polyclinics to seek medical attention promptly.  +The risk of picking up Covid-19 for people who have travelled is really much higher than the general population,+ he added.","8":"SINGAPORE - Singapore has managed to ramp up its import of eggs from other countries following Malaysia+s lockdown on Wednesday (March 18), Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Thursday.  About 73 per cent of Singapore+s eggs are from Malaysia, according to last published official figures from 2018, and Malaysia+s latest Covid-19 movement restriction order has left some worried about Singapore+s egg supply.  But Mr Chan reiterated on Facebook that +we also have many other source countries which we have identified over the years and are able activate them quickly when the need calls for it+.  +This applies not just to eggs but other food products and essential items... These efforts to secure and diversify our food supply have been developed and strengthened through the years,+ he said.  The minister was at Changi Airport on Thursday to receive \u201cvery special cargo\u201d - 300,000 eggs from Thailand.  Singapore also imports eggs from accredited farms in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. About a quarter of all eggs Singaporeans consume daily are produced locally.  The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said on Wednesday that Singapore+s food supply has not been disrupted by Malaysia+s two-week lockdown.  Mr Chan added in his latest Facebook post: +Even though we have a robust plan in place, we do not take it for granted and reassess it regularly to test its robustness against different scenarios.  +This is how things have always been done in Singapore and will continue to guide our approach to all issues, big and small, going forward.+  He thanked the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, the SFA , Singapore Airlines and Changi Airport+s main airline caterer Sats for their quick response in facilitating the larger import of eggs.

Among them, 33 were imported and 30 involved Singapore residents returning from abroad. This brought the total number of cases here to 313.  In light of these recent developments, it is vital that people mind their health, and take the necessary precautions should they feel unwell.  Q: What are the symptoms for Covid-19?  The two most common symptoms for Covid-19 are fever (of 37.8 deg C and above) and cough.  Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam said that those who are experiencing either of the two symptoms, or both, should consult a doctor.  He also added that those who feel generally unwell should also see a doctor, noting that practically all the identified Covid-19 cases had the sensation of being unwell at some point.  Q: What about mild, flu-like symptoms which are not fever and cough? Should I visit the doctor as well?  Other mild, flu-like symptoms such as sore throat, stuffy nose and runny nose should be monitored closely for at least five days, said Dr Leong, as sore throat and stuffy nose were not symptoms present in 90 per cent of the confirmed Covid-19 cases.  However, people should look out for any prolonged or worsening symptoms, as well as new, developing symptoms, he noted, and see a doctor if these occur.  In the meantime, individuals should practise self-quarantine measures at home and avoid going out, as there is a chance they could be incubating the virus.  Q: Can I self-medicate at home if I+m facing any of the above symptoms?  You may self-medicate if you are facing mild symptoms. However, you should visit a doctor if the symptoms are prolonged or worsening.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  If you are having a cough or fever, which are common Covid-19 symptoms, you should definitely visit a doctor.  On whether people suffering from Covid-19 symptoms should avoid taking ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug meant for fever and pain, Dr Leong said that it has not yet been clinically proven that the drug predisposes the body to more infections.  But he suggests they choose alternatives such as paracetamol, synflex or voltaren as a precautionary measure.  Q: Should I visit the doctor if I+m experiencing breathlessness?  Yes, although breathlessness does not usually develop until the later stages of Covid-19. By then, individuals would have experienced other accompanying symptoms as well, noted Dr Leong.  Dr Piotr Chlebicki, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Alvernia Hospital, also shared the same advice, adding that breathlessness is cause for medical attention, as the individual could be facing other complications like heart disease or asthma.  Q: What if I am asymptomatic so far, but I don+t feel very well in general, should I still see the doctor?  Yes, as long as you are feeling unwell, or sense that something is out of the ordinary, it would be a good idea to visit the doctor.  Dr Chlebicki also suggested that it would be good practice to call in to clinics before going, as this could help reduce overcrowding.  In addition, you should also refrain from doctor-hopping, said MOH in an advisory on March 11, as going back to the same doctor could ensure follow-up, and that you+re sent for Covid-19 testing if necessary.","11":"SINGAPORE - The Republic has confirmed 32 new coronavirus patients, including 24 imported cases, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Thursday (March 19).  This is a drop from the 47 new cases that were recorded on Wednesday, the highest number since the start of the outbreak.  All of the imported cases were returning residents and long-term pass holders, with the bulk having travelled to Europe - currently the epicentre of the virus. Most patients who visited Europe were in Britain \u2013 13 patients \u2013 while the others had visited countries like Switzerland and France.  As for the other imported cases, they had visited other countries such as the United States and parts of Asia like Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines.

A district court heard that the man even lied to the minor, claiming that he reciprocated her feelings even though he felt no romantic attachment to her.  Deputy Public Prosecutor Ho Jiayun said: +Ultimately, he took advantage of her youthful affection for him... and saw her merely as a means to satisfy his own sexual desire.+  On Thursday (March 19), the 33-year-old man was sentenced to three years and seven months+ jail after pleading guilty to two counts of sexually penetrating a minor.  He also admitted to one count of sexually exploiting a child. Four other similar charges involving the same girl were considered during sentencing.  Due to a gag order, details of the offender and the school cannot be revealed to protect the victim+s identity.  The court heard that he had been one of the girl+s teachers since she was a Secondary 1 student in 2017.  The following year, the pair started exchanging text messages and initially chatted about school work.  But over time, they started discussing personal issues and became closer.  Related Story 5 years+ jail and 12 strokes of cane for man who molested daughter  Related Story Jail for former accredited Islamic religious teacher who kissed young pupil on her lips  The pair exchanged text messages, including sexually charged ones, every day by early last year.  The girl later told her teacher that she +liked+ him. He lied, claiming he felt the same way.  When school ended at around 2pm on Feb 15 last year, the man took the girl back to his flat and asked her to perform oral sex on him.  The minor did as she was told and he later drove her back to school so that her mother could pick her up.  During the school holidays on March 17 last year, the man conspired with the girl to lie to her mother, claiming that she had to attend a remedial class the next day.  He picked her up from her mother+s workplace at around 10am the next day, and they went to his flat where he performed oral sex on the girl. He also sexually penetrated her.  His offences came to light on April 4 last year when the girl+s father noticed that she was using an iPhone 6.  When the father asked her about the phone, he was told it was a gift from the teacher.  A check on the phone also uncovered messages suggesting a romantic relationship between the pair.  The father alerted the school principal, who lodged a police report two days later.  Urging the court to sentence the offender to more than four years+ jail, DPP Ho told District Judge Christopher Goh that the girl had trusted the teacher to nurture and educate her.  The DPP added: +He abused this trust by sexually exploiting the victim and leading her down the path of moral corruption.+  For each count of sexually penetrating a minor, the man could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined.  The Ministry of Education (MOE) said in response to queries by The Straits Times that it was unable to take internal disciplinary action against the man as police investigations were ongoing at the time of the case and he had also resigned from the teaching service in April last year before he was charged with any offences.

In a post on the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) Facebook page on Thursday (March 19), Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir said that Muslims here should +play (their) part+ and not attend such gatherings, which have caused widespread infection of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  +I hear that some foreign religious organisers say that they fear God more than viruses and therefore, they continue with gatherings,+ said Dr Nazirudin.  +This is not the time to be senseless and irresponsible. I would like to be absolutely clear.+  From Feb 27 to March 1, more than 16,000 devotees had gathered at the Masjid Jamek Sri Petaling in Kuala Lumpur.  This gathering, believed to be for followers of the Tablighi Jama+at, a Muslim missionary movement, has since turned into a large cluster after hundreds of its attendees were infected with the Covid-19 virus.  At least five Singaporeans who returned here from this gathering have tested positive for Covid-19.  So far, 101 Singaporeans have been identified as having attended the gathering in Malaysia.  Mosques islandwide are currently closed for two weeks to prevent the coronavirus from spreading any further in religious institutions here.

On Thursday, it was reported that organisers of a Tablighi Jama+at gathering in Indonesia+s South Sulawesi province were convinced by the authorities at the last minute to cancel the event - but not before more than 8,000 Muslim pilgrims from around the world already assembled there.  Dr Nazirudin said in the Facebook post that Muslims should be responsible and not be reckless by attending such events.  +I would caution our community against going to such gatherings. You are part of a responsible and sensible community. Please play your part,+ he said.  +Religion is about priorities too, and our priority right now is not to endanger ourselves or others.+","15":"PUTRAJAYA - Malaysia could temporarily lift its travel ban for citizens who commute to Singapore for work, if they can be housed there, Senior Minister for Security Ismail Sabri Yaakob said on Thursday (March 19).  Speaking to reporters at a press conference at the Prime Minister+s office, Mr Ismail noted the +worrying+ predicament of these workers whose livelihoods were affected when Malaysia closed its border for a fortnight as part of its Restricted Movement Order (RMO).  Some 300,000 Malaysians work in Singapore. About a half of them are believed to be daily commuters.  +We are negotiating and we have suggested that the 300,000 are allowed to continue working in Singapore on condition Singapore prepares lodgings for them,+ said Datuk Seri Ismail, who is also the defence minister. +This matter is under discussion. God willing, we will make an announcement soon.+  He said the matter has been discussed by Malaysia Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong as well as between himself and his Singapore counterpart Teo Chee Hean. Malaysia+s Senior Minister for Economy Azmin Ali and his Singapore counterpart Chan Chun Sing have also been in talks.  A day earlier, the Johor state government similarly said it hopes to reopen the border with Singapore. Johor Menteri Besar Hasni Mohammad was reported as saying this would be done with more stringent health checks at the border.  Mr Ismail, who is also the Umno vice-president, also warned on Wednesday that the military may have to be activated if Malaysians fail to adhere to instructions to stay home.  On Wednesday, many across the country still gathered in public places such as food courts and public parks.  +It was suggested and discussed, the likely outcome if the situation cannot be fully controlled, is that the military will be utilised.

But despite being warned not to cheat, a significant number allegedly shared their answers and plagiarised one another.  NUS is now scrutinising their submissions and identifying the alleged cheaters so action can be taken against them.  Replying to queries from The New Paper, a spokesman for the NUS School of Computing confirmed it is investigating, with instructors still making plagiarism checks and have yet to finalise the results.  +NUS takes a serious view of academic dishonesty and does not condone plagiarism,+ she said.  TNP understands Mr Prabawa Adi Yoga Sidi, the lecturer teaching the module, sent out an e-mail about a week ago urging students who had cheated to confess.  It is believed that several have come forward and admitted to plagiarism.  The exam is worth 15 per cent of the final grade for the programming methodology module, which is compulsory for engineering students.  The module, also known as CS1010E, is described as an introduction to fundamental concepts of problem solving, involving the use of computing and programming in the Python programming language.  The spokesman said about 680 students are taking the module in the current semester.  CLASS SETTING  The exam is usually held in a class setting, but in light of Covid-19, Mr Prabawa allowed it to be taken at home earlier this month.  Related Story NUS reminds students to declare travel plans after foreign exchange student expelled  Students had to log in at the same time to work independently on three tasks, comprising seven questions, and submit their answers online.  The spokesman said students were reminded that there would be plagiarism checks and penalties if they were caught.  According to NUS policies, students who plagiarise or aid and abet such actions may be subject to disciplinary action.  +In addition, the student may receive a reduced grade, possibly even a zero mark, for the relevant academic assignment, project or thesis, and could receive a failed grade for the module,+ said the spokesman.  +Any student caught plagiarising will be required to retain the plagiarised module as graded.+  Numerous posts on Facebook page NUSWhispers in the past week claimed to be from students taking the module.  Some claimed they had cheated because the conditions were difficult and it was to be expected, while others said they had learnt their lesson.  One post, addressed to Mr Prabawa, claimed that if disciplinary action was taken, it would be the school+s fault that +almost half+ of the students would be severely affected and face problems with graduation and finding jobs.  Another post said students were +begging for mercy+, as the plagiarism checks are +almost a death sentence+.  Related Story Interactive: How coronavirus is spreading across the world  Commenting on one of the posts, Mr Prabawa said the instructors were able to measure similarities in submissions and identify possible collaborations within groups, and this will be investigated further.  +Plagiarism is not a victimless crime. The students who are not plagiarising are being victimised. So we need to protect the victims,+ he said.  The spokesman said: +The school is aware of the diverse views raised by students.+  She said that instructors will address their concerns and plan to conduct optional remedial sessions to help those who had difficulties with the module.","17":"SINGAPORE - A recession in Singapore +appears inevitable+, said DBS Bank as it now sees the economy shrinking by 0.5 per cent this year, instead of the 0.9 per cent growth it forecast last month.  This downgraded forecast still comes with significant downside risks should the coronavirus outbreak worsen further, DBS economist Irvin Seah said in a research note on Thursday (March 19).  He also expects total retrenchments for the year to reach about 24,500, slightly above the 23,430 in 2009 during the Global Financial Crisis.  +Considering the chaotic situation in many parts of the world and the economic costs of those restrictive measures on trade, investment, consumption and travel, this is evolving into a +self-induced+ global recession. Being a small and open economy, Singapore will not be spared,+ he said.  Mr Seah said a second stimulus package of up to $14 billion to $16 billion could be rolled out, funded by the remaining Budget surplus for this term of Government of about $7.7 billion and an additional $6 billion to $8 billion from the reserves.  A $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package was announced during the Budget statement last month.  He also expects the Monetary Authority of Singapore to take a more aggressive monetary response amid falling inflation and the significant downside risk to growth.  +Specifically, we expect MAS to end the modest and gradual appreciation path of the SGD NEER (nominal effective exchange rate) policy band, and introduce a downward re-centring of the band by up to 2 per cent. In fact, an announcement before the next scheduled policy meeting around mid-April should not come as a surprise, given the urgency of the matter,+ he said.  Mr Seah said he expects year-on-year contractions of up to 2 percentage points for the first two quarters of the year - which would be a technical recession - and a contraction in the third quarter before an improvement at the end of the year.  He noted that this comes after the bank revised Singapore+s gross domestic product growth forecast down to 0.9 per cent on Feb 7. But back then, the Covid-19 outbreak was still largely contained within China, with only pockets of infection elsewhere.  The situation has deteriorated sharply since then, with the number of infections in other parts of the world multiplying by more than 400 times, he said.  Also, travel restrictions imposed by Singapore have been broadened beyond China to cover markets accounting for about 69 per cent of Singapore+s total tourist arrivals last year, he said.  These include South Korea, Britain, Japan, France and Asean countries.  Related Story Deeper wage offsets, foreign worker levy waivers on wish list  Related Story MAS says it stands ready to ensure the stability of Singapore+s financial system amid coronavirus spread  As such, the services sector - particular tourism-related industries such as hotels and restaurants, aviation, point-to-point transport services, retail and entertainments services will be severely impacted.  A sharp contraction in global demand would also put a dent on the near-term prospects for Singapore+s exports and the manufacturing sector, said Mr Seah, adding that global economic activity will slow significantly, as governments around the world have introduced city- and country-wide lockdowns and border closures, and companies have put in place business continuity plans.  He said that Singapore+s downturn this year will be a lot deeper than that during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, and more painful than the Global Financial Crisis in 2009.  In these two downturns, Singapore still managed to post GDP growth of 4.5 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively, he said.  He noted that the previous occasions when Singapore saw full year contractions were during the Dot.com Bust in 2001 (-1.1 per cent), the Asian Financial Crisis in 1999 (-2.2 per cent) and the manufacturing recession in 1985 (-0.6 per cent).  For the second government support package, Mr Seah proposed the following measures:  \u2022 Broaden the temporary bridging loan scheme to include all industries;  \u2022 Increase the quantum of the temporary bridging loan scheme to up to $2 million, up from $1 million;  \u2022 Increase the quantum of the working capital loan scheme to up to $1 million, up from $600,000;  \u2022 Raise wage subsidy under the Jobs Support Scheme to 12 per cent for all Singaporean workers, up from 8 per cent, with the grant covering six months instead of three;  \u2022 Disburse a one-off cash grant to micro and small enterprises immediately; and,  \u2022 Waive for one month the foreign worker levy for workers affected by measures introduced to counter the spread of Covid-19.  He also hopes to see more help for workers at risk of losing their jobs, such as deferment of personal income tax payments for all retrenched workers, a one-off retrenchment benefit for those displaced, and tax deductions for profitable companies to hire retrenched workers.  Other economists are still expecting the economy to grow over the year, for now.  OCBC Bank chief economist Selena Ling said the bank\u2019s latest forecast for Singapore\u2019s full year GDP growth is 0.3 per cent.  She added that this will be reassessed based on GDP growth data for the first quarter of this year, which will be released next month, the upcoming second fiscal stimulus package, MAS\u2019 expected monetary policy easing, and whether Malaysia will extend its Movement Control Order beyond March 31.  United Overseas Bank\u2019s growth forecast for this year is 0.5 per cent, though there are further downside risks, said the bank\u2019s economist Barnabas Gan.  He said that the estimates also assume a potential technical recession in the first half of the year.  \u201cAccounting for the direct negative effects on Singapore\u2019s tourism industry as well as secondary effects on Asia\u2019s supply chain and external environment, we perceive Singapore\u2019s output gap to stay negative for the whole of 2020,\u201d he said, meaning that the Republic\u2019s economy is expected to perform below its potential.","18":"SINGAPORE - St Andrew+s Cathedral, the oldest Anglican site of worship in Singapore, has been closed after one of its members was infected with the coronavirus.

Students and staff members of schools, pre-schools and student care centres will be given 14-day leave of absence if they returned from overseas on or after March 14.  The date of their return to Singapore will be taken as Day Zero of the 14 days.  The moves comes amid a recent spike in the number of imported cases. Eight out of 10 of Singapore\u2019s imported cases of Covid-19 have come in the last nine days.  The decision to reopen schools and pre-schools came amid speculation that the one-week school holidays which began on March 14 might be extended, especially after the number of new infections reached a new high of 47 on Wednesday.  Instead, additional precautionary measures will be put in place.  Students who will have to miss classes will be supported through home-based learning.

The outbreak would have hit its peak by July, after which the number of infections here would start going down, said Associate Professor Alexander Cook, vice-dean for research at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.","21":"SINGAPORE - Singaporeans and residents returning to the country will all have to serve a 14-day stay-home notice (SHN), the authorities said on Wednesday (March 18), as Singapore reported 47 new Covid-19 cases, an all-time high.  The move, which will take effect from 11.59pm on Friday (March 20), was among new measures announced to contain the spread of coronavirus cases. To date, Singapore has reported a total of 313 cases.  Here+s what you need to know about SHN, based on the Ministry of Health advisory:  1. Am I under quarantine orders if I am on SHN?  No, you are not under quarantine orders and are not required to have a dedicated room and toilet if this is not feasible. However, you should remain in your place of residence at all times during the 14-day period.  2. What is the difference between leave of absence and SHN?  People taking leave of absence are allowed to leave their place of residence to purchase daily necessities or to attend to important personal matters.  Those issued a SHN should remain in their place of residence at all times during the 14-day period.  3. Can my family members continue to stay with me during this time? Are they at risk of infection?  Your family members may continue to live with you. However, you and your family should observe good personal hygiene practices. If you become unwell, avoid contact with your family members and seek medical attention immediately.  4. My family members\/flatmates\/tenants have just returned from one of the affected areas. Can I still carry on with my daily activities, such as going to work or school?  Yes, the SHN applies only to persons returning from affected areas listed in the advisory (NOTE: From Friday, March 20, at 11.59pm, the SHN will be extended to all people arriving from overseas). Nonetheless, you should continue to monitor your health, observe good personal hygiene and seek medical attention if unwell.  5. Do I need to declare to my employers\/schools that I am on SHN?  Those who have returned from the affected areas are advised to inform their employers or schools that they are on SHN. This is so that your employer or school can provide the necessary assistance to facilitate your SHN.  6. If I am delivering food\/supplies to a person under SHN, should I wear a mask or other protective equipment to protect myself?  There is no need for masks or other protective equipment. The delivery can be conducted in such a way as to minimise contact with the person under SHN. The SHN is a precautionary measure and persons under SHN are not close contacts of confirmed cases.  7. Can I send my employees\/students to the doctor to get tested at the end of the 14-day period so that they can be cleared to come back to work\/return to school?  It is not useful to send persons who do not have symptoms to the doctor\/hospital for testing. Such individuals will not be offered diagnostic testing, and will be asked to return home.  8. What if I do not comply with the SHN?  If you fail to comply with the SHN, you may face the following penalties, as you have put the well-being of the wider community at risk:  a. You may be prosecuted under Section 21A of the Infectious Diseases Act.  b. If you are a Singapore permanent resident, long-term-visit pass holder, dependant+s pass holder, or student+s pass holder, your re-entry permit or passes may be revoked or the validity shortened.  c. If you are a foreign employee issued with a work pass, your work pass may be revoked.  d. If your child\/ward is a full-time student attending a pre-school, school or other educational institution in Singapore, your child\/ward might be subjected to disciplinary action, including suspension or dismissal.  For foreign students, this may include the cancellation of your child+s\/ward+s student+s pass or dependant+s pass.  9. What if I require medical attention while on SHN?  For life-threatening cases such as cardiac arrest, active seizures, breathlessness, major traumas and stroke, please call 995 directly for assistance.  For non-emergencies (such as cough or fever, follow-up visits for chronic conditions, refilling of prescription, etc):  a. For Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders, you may contact the People+s Association (PA) at 6344-8222. PA will assist you to make the necessary arrangements with the nearest Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC) or GP clinic, or to arrange for a house call by a GP (for those with mobility issues).  Please inform the staff and doctor of your travel history and that you have been issued an SHN.  b. For students\/pre-school students, you can seek assistance from your school or MOE\/ECDA.  c. For foreign employees issued with a work pass, you should contact your employer.  10. If I am worried about my status (whether or not I am infected), can I go to a hospital or the National Centre for Infectious Diseases to get tested?  Diagnostic testing is available for symptomatic individuals who are admitted to hospital on suspicion of infection. If you develop a fever, cough or breathlessness, or are feeling unwell, you should seek medical attention. Your doctor will assess and refer you to the hospital if necessary.

Mr Gan said there is also collaboration with private hospitals +to see if we can send some non-Covid patients to them+.  He added: +We already have ongoing collaborations.

This comes just after police said last Thursday that another three teens were arrested for a similar stunt.  The police said in a statement on Wednesday that they received a report that a male victim was on the ground floor of the shopping mall in Victoria Street when spittle falling from a higher floor of the mall landed on him.  Preliminary investigations showed that the three boys had spat over the railing from the fifth floor of the mall last Thursday, some time after 5pm.  With the help of police cameras, officers from the Central Police Division established the identities of the boys.  The teenagers are being investigated by the police for being a public nuisance.  The police said that the incident caused alarm and annoyance,in the light of the coronavirus outbreak, since infections can spread indirectly through contaminated surfaces.  The arrests come in the wake of similar incidents also involving teenagers.  Last Thursday, three other teenagers, two boys and one girl aged between 17 and 19, were arrested over a suspected spitting incident in a shopping mall in central Singapore.  Police last month also apprehended two boys aged 12 and 17 for allegedly spitting inside public lifts in Housing Board blocks.

Products such as pharmaceuticals and infant diapers have also been allowed through the checkpoints, although there has been feedback from companies that some trucks bearing non-food supplies have not been let through, he said in a Facebook post.  +I+m glad to see that the supply of fresh food has not been fully disrupted... We are monitoring the situation closely and are in touch with our Malaysian counterparts to ensure that food and other supplies will be able to come through to Singapore,+ Mr Chan said.  His update comes a day after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said an agreement had been worked out with Malaysia over the continued movement of cargo between both countries during the lockdown that is expected to last till the end of the month.  Malaysia+s Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced the measure to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the country on Monday night, sparking concerns among Singaporeans that regular food imports from Malaysia could be disrupted.  Singapore imports about 37 per cent of its chicken supply and 15 per cent of its fish from Malaysia, among produce like eggs, vegetables and milk.  Mr Chan said he spoke to Malaysian Minister of International Trade and Industry Azmin Ali on Wednesday afternoon.  +We both noted that it is in our mutual interest to ensure that supply chains remain robust and in working order, and agreed that we must maintain confidence in our people and businesses in order to successfully overcome the challenges posed by Covid-19,+ Mr Chan said.  He added that economic agencies are working with companies to minimise disruption to supply lines, with some companies already having activated sea and air freights to bring in sufficient supplies.  When The Straits Times visited several wet markets on Wednesday morning, stall owners generally said they had no problem receiving fresh supplies, although fishmongers in a few places said their supplies had been halved.  A 43-year-old fishmonger at Ghim Moh Market, who wanted to be known only as Mr Lee, said he received about 30 to 40 per cent fewer fish than usual.  +Some of the suppliers and their staff were not able to unload the fish here. It+s more difficult for fresh food because we need the supply to come in on a daily basis,+ he said.  Still, Mr Lee Boon Cheow, former president of the Singapore Fish Merchants\u2019 General Association, said: \u201cWe are still getting fish from Malaysia at usual prices.  \u201cSingapore also gets its seafood from various other countries such as China and Thailand, so I\u2019m not too concerned about the lockdown.\u201d  The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) affirmed that the country\u2019s food supply is not affected by Malaysia\u2019s movement control order.  It also said that based on feedback from importers, there are currently no disruptions to the country+s fish supply from Malaysia.  Its spokesman also said that Singapore imports food, including eggs, chicken and vegetables, from more than 170 countries and regions.  Should one source dry up, it will work with importers to tap on alternative sources and ensure food supply remains stable.  SFA has also been investing in local production to serve as a buffer when imports are disrupted.  In his Facebook post, Mr Chan also noted that some Malaysian workers who have decided to stay in Singapore for the next two weeks have managed to secure accommodation.

The payment will be funded by a $25 million sum set aside by NTUC, unions and the Government, and applies only to union members.  Those who are self-employed and are union members are also eligible for the NTUC Care Fund (Covid-19).  +Workers in Singapore, especially those in sectors such as aviation, tourism and point-to-point transport, are experiencing hardship due to losses in income amid the Covid-19 outbreak,+ NTUC said.  +NTUC, its affiliated unions and associations, together with the Singapore Government, are banding together in a show of support to help our workers by providing them with temporary cash relief which will help to ease their daily expenses during this period of hardship.+  Private-sector economists had earlier said that Singapore can expect its economy to contract by 0.8 per cent in the first quarter due to the pandemic.

In response to queries from The Straits Times, a PA spokesman said on Wednesday (March 18) that it is also cancelling the other Hari Raya festive bazaars it usually organises.  +For the well-being and safety of our residents, the PA will not be organising festive bazaars and trade fairs with effect from March 18, 2020. This includes the annual Hari Raya Bazaars organised at Wisma Geylang Serai as well as at Our Tampines Hub and in Woodlands,+ said the spokesman.  +As the festive bazaars contribute to the festive mood, we understand that some residents may be disappointed. However, as our bazaars attract large crowds, we have taken the difficult decision not to proceed with these activities.+  The month-long festive bazaars held during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan across the island attract large crowds.  The bazaars are known for the wide variety of food sold, festive clothes and household decorations.  In response to the growing number of Covid-19 cases here, and to prevent community spread, the Government on March 13 had announced that all ticketed cultural, sports and entertainment events with 250 participants or more were to be deferred or cancelled.  It also issued an advisory on social distancing in public venues, and to defer or cancel all non-essential events and gatherings.  Earlier this month, it was reported that the PA had opened a new tender for this year+s Geylang Serai Ramadan Bazaar at the Wisma Geylang Serai social and cultural heritage hub.  This tender, which closed on Monday, attracted bids by Adex Group and separately, Corpbiz Events.  PA had opened a tender earlier but this was closed on Jan 17 without the tender being awarded.

Last year, about two million people attended the bazaar at Wisma Geylang Serai - the highest ever number recorded for such a bazaar.  It surpassed the 1.8 million visitors the year before.

The Protection from Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) office said in a statement on Wednesday (March 18) that the deputy chairman of PA, Mr Chan Chun Sing, has initiated the latest correction order on posts about the Feb 15 Safra Jurong Chinese New Year function that has so far surfaced 47 cases of confirmed Covid-19 infections here.  All three - Mr Lim, +Henryace Ace+ and Mr Sebastian Ying - posted or shared links saying the PA and RCs were responsible for the infections linked to the event.  Mr Lim, who is the People+s Voice party chief, did so on both his pages Lim Tean and Tean Lim.

It said: +PA and the RCs were not involved in the organisation of the dinner event... and were not in a position to cancel it. PA and the RCs also did not fund or publicise the dinner event.  +The event was a private dinner function organised by a singing instructor for members of her singing groups.+  This is the third time Mr Lim has been issued with an order from the Pofma office, with the first time being in December last year for a post which the Government said had implied that it was spending more on foreign students than Singaporean students.

Gone were the crowds, the bumper-to-bumper traffic and the frenetic activity, as Malaysia+s lockdown kicked in on Wednesday morning (March 18), and the land checkpoints between Singapore and Malaysia emptied.  The Woodlands Causeway and Tuas Second Link, which usually see about 415,000 travellers daily, shut normal operations as Malaysia proceeded with its latest effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus, announced by Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin on Monday night.  From midnight, all Malaysians are barred from travelling abroad, while all foreign tourists and visitors to the country are banned.  Malaysians returning from overseas must also undergo a health inspection and self-quarantine for 14 days.

Malaysians are the only nationality, apart from Singaporeans and permanent residents, who can work here as licensed security officers.  Firms here have scrambled to persuade their Malaysian employees, most of whom commute daily across the Causeway for work, to stay - and to secure accommodation for them.  President of the Security Association Singapore Raj Joshua Thomas estimates that about 10,000 to 15,000 security officers are Malaysians, who will be cut off from Singapore by the travel ban. This makes up about one-third of the security officer workforce here, he estimated.  Malaysia announced on Monday night (March 16) that it is imposing a movement control order prohibiting Malaysians from leaving the country, as well as foreigners from entering. It will come into force at midnight on Wednesday (March 18).  Since the announcement, security firms have rushed to make arrangements for their Malaysian workforce.  Mr Robert Wiener, president of the Association of Certified Security Agencies, said firms have sent their workers home early to pack their bags and return to Singapore ahead of the midnight deadline.  Businesses are following the Ministry of Manpower+s recommendations to house workers with relatives, friends or colleagues, or in commercial properties like dormitories and hotels.  However, Mr Thomas said firms hope the rules can be relaxed to allow workers to temporarily stay in office premises with reasonable conditions. There are strict rules governing the housing of foreign employees, aimed at preventing employers from housing their employees in illegal dormitories.  +We are looking at around $25 to $30 to house a person in a dormitory, and this is high cost - it can be more than what the agency can earn per day, per officer. It doesn+t make (fiscal) sense to put them up there,+ said Mr Thomas.  Despite the high costs, firms are keen to keep their workers instead of hiring new ones, as it takes time to train and license a security officer.

Almost all commute across the border daily for work, and about two in three said they will take up the company+s offer of accommodation in hostels or hotels, he added.  Other companies report that their Malaysian employees are also keen on staying on.  A Certis spokesman said that less than five per cent of its total workforce decided to remain in Malaysia.  The integrated security services firm is also arranging temporary lodging for affected workers, and will provide some basic necessities and laundry services.  But firms are wary that there will still be a shortfall in manpower despite their best efforts.  Mr Thomas said it is +inevitable+ that there will be manpower shortages, and security agencies will need to streamline operations to meet security outcomes.  The firms can look at measures such as reducing patrol points to just critical ones, or even to limit the number of entry points in a building to help security officers in screening, he said.  Related Story Malaysia reports first two deaths due to coronavirus  Mr Wiener added that most clients have been understanding about the situation, and have agreed to work out a new arrangement with the security firms without pursuing additional compensation.  While the situation is bound to have a negative impact on firms in terms of costs, he said, it could also result in +a turn in the right direction+ and get firms to re-evaluate their labour-intensive processes and look into adopting more smart technology.

It+s certainly a very extreme measure, and we don+t think we need to get there if we do all the things we have been doing, we have been advocating, and we do them well.+  Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force set up to deal with the coronavirus situation, was responding to a question on whether Singapore would consider such a measure decided on by Malaysia.  Malaysia had announced that its citizens would not be allowed to travel overseas for two weeks starting from Wednesday (March 18), as part of a slew of measures to arrest the spread of the coronavirus.  All schools, universities, and businesses there would be shut, and all public gatherings banned during this period, although essential services would continue, Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin had said.  Mr Wong said that if the multiple lines of defences that the Government has put in place - such as border controls, contact tracing, and social distancing - can be tightened, then Singapore need not reach a situation where the entire city has to be locked down.  +We could potentially do, for example... a major circuit breaker that doesn+t entail a lockdown, but entails school closures, workplace closures, and doing it on a temporary basis over a period of two to three weeks, just as the Malaysians have done.+  +So there is a whole range of measures that we have in our toolkit, and we constantly monitor the environment, the risk situation, and then we will adjust our measures,+ he added.  At the press conference, also attended by Manpower Minister Josephine Teo and Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, the authorities said it was helping companies which employ Malaysian workers, especially those that provide essential services, to find temporary accommodation in Singapore.  Mr Wong said that the land crossing with Malaysia is something that needed special consideration given the high volume of people and goods passing through.  +That+s why we+ve been discussing this matter bilaterally, but in recent days, the Malaysians, seeing the seriousness of the matter within their own country... decided that they needed a swift and urgent response.+  He said that if and when these measures are lifted by Malaysia, things cannot go back to +business as usual+.

The successful extradition from Britain marks the end of a lengthy process to have Roach return to Singapore+s shores.  Singapore had to reassure the British government that he would not be caned if he were to be convicted of robbery, which is an offence that comes with mandatory caning here.  British laws prohibit the authorities from extraditing Roach without such an undertaking. The country had abolished caning for criminals in 1948.

If employees do not have enough annual leave, employers may require them to use advance leave or take no-pay leave, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the National Trades Union Congress and the Singapore National Employers Federation said in a joint statement on Monday (March 16).  This comes in the wake of wider border restrictions as Singapore moves to reduce the risk of Covid-19 importation.  Employers should remind employees of the latest Health Ministry+s travel advisory to defer all non-essential travel plans to all countries, and also obtain a travel declaration from their workers for their upcoming overseas plans, the tripartite partners said.  In the latest border restrictions that were announced by the Government on Sunday, from 11.59pm on Monday, all travellers - including Singapore citizens, permanent residents, long-term pass holders and short-term visitors - entering Singapore with recent travel history to Asean countries, Japan, Switzerland or the United Kingdom within the last 14 days will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice.  But this will exclude Singaporeans and Malaysians using sea and land crossings with Malaysia, given the large numbers who cross these borders daily.  For employers and self-employed workers who proceed with travel plans after Sunday, they will not be eligible for the $100 daily support when affected workers serve out their mandatory stay-home requirements.  Previously on Feb 21, MOM had said that employers should not force their staff to take leave for their mandatory 14-day stay-home notice or leave of absence or risk having their work pass privileges suspended.  But in other guidelines issued on Monday, employers are also expected to provide additional paid leave for workers who proceed with work-related travel plans if necessary.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  This paid leave is to cover quarantine or self-isolation periods, any delay in return to Singapore due to flight unavailability or the need for pre-entry approval, as well as stay-home notices or leave of absence that might be required.  Employers should also accede to staff+s requests to abstain from work-related travel and not penalise them for it, the tripartite partners said.  Employers are advised to communicate and explain all policies to their workers before implementing them.","53":"SINGAPORE - The Republic has a robust multi-pronged strategy that will ensure the country does not run out of the essentials it needs, said Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Monday night (March 16).  This is on top of building up the country+s inventory of food and essential supplies, he said on Facebook.  He gave this assurance following concerns among Singaporeans over the implications of Malaysia\u2019s announcement earlier on Monday that it will restrict all movement throughout the country from Wednesday until March 31 to prevent further spread of the coronavirus within the country.  All Malaysians will be barred from travelling abroad. For those who are returning from overseas, they must undergo a health inspection and undergo self-quarantine for 14 days.  There will also be a ban on all foreign tourists and visitors.  Photos of queues at various supermarkets here on Monday evening started circulating online after Malaysia\u2019s announcement, with shoppers snapping up food products and daily necessities.  Mr Chan added that the Republic is not facing any immediate risks of running out of food or other supplies brought in by retailers.  He explained that this is because the Singapore Government has been actively working with supermarket chains such as NTUC FairPrice, Sheng Siong and Dairy Farm to increase the country+s stock of food and essential supplies over the last two months.  On ensuring the country does not run out of essentials, Mr Chan said that Singapore has local production capabilities for products such as noodles, infant milk powder and canned goods among others.  \u201cIn the event that we need to increase supply for our domestic consumption, we can ramp up quickly and easily to do so,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe have also continued to diversify our sources of essential goods, for example we get a good amount of vegetables from China and even go as far as Australia and Spain to secure our supply of eggs.\u201d  Even so, Mr Chan urged Singaporeans to continue to purchase in a responsible manner and to purchase only what they need. +Otherwise, no amount of stockpiling will be sufficient.+  On Monday night, Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced movement restrictions on the country, from Wednesday until March 31.    Shoppers queueing at Giant supermarket in Toa Payoh on March 16, 2020. ST PHOTO: LINETTE LAI    Mr Muhyiddin urged Malaysia to abide by the restrictions, adding that the country+s national security council will meet daily to monitor the situation.  He also said that food and medical supplies including face masks will be sufficient.  The limits include a ban on mass gatherings, including religious, sports, social and cultural events.  With the latest development in Malaysia, Mr Chan said that businesses that employ Malaysian workers who commute between Singapore and Malaysia daily may have to activate their business continuity plans.  \u201cIf they need assistance, they should contact our economic agencies who stand ready to assist,\u201d he said, adding that Singapore will also continue to stay in touch with Malaysia, and to ensure that businesses and people are able to continue with their lives and livelihoods.  \u201cI am aware that many of these new restrictions and announcements may be quite overwhelming for many people. I ask for your continued trust and support as we work hard with all stakeholders to ensure that we get through these short-term challenges together,\u201d said Mr Chan.  For now, consumers like Madam Catherine Heng, 50, are worried about Malaysia\u2019s restrictions but also note that it lasts about two weeks.  She decided to stock up for the weekend just to be on the safe side, buying potatoes, carrots, spinach and a tray of eggs.  \u201cYou can\u2019t keep fresh vegetables for too long anyway - the only things that can keep are the potatoes and carrots,\u201d she said.  Another shopper, who only wanted to be known as Madam Ng, said she went to a FairPrice outlet in Yishun to stock up on essential supplies as she was afraid the Malaysia restrictions would result in a supply cut.  Madam Ng, who works in telecommunications, went to the supermarket with her daughter and two sons after reading about Malaysia\u2019s move, and said that among the things she bought were two 10kg bags of rice.  \u201cWhen we came at about 11pm, it was not so crowded. But the crowd suddenly grew very big,\u201d she said, adding that she will return on Tuesday to stock up on vegetables which were not available.  Mr Kelvin Sin, 38, said he rushed down to the FairPrice outlet near his Yishun home with his brother on hearing the news.  \u201cEveryone feels nervous. We are afraid we can\u2019t get supplies of things like fresh meat,\u201d he said.  Financial analyst Radhika Singh, 36, also headed to the Giant supermarket in Toa Payoh on hearing of Malaysia+s announcement and got a large tray of eggs, canned tuna, pasta and spinach. She said she needed to stock up as her three children will be eating most of their meals at home this week, as it is the school holidays.  \u201cThis should be enough for two weeks and hopefully the situation will be resolved by then,\u201d she said.  As for one owner of a food import-export firm at Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre, he was not too worried.  The owner, who wanted to be known only as Mr Chia, believes there are definitely enough stocks, in part because the market has been very slow and \u201cwe have a lot of vegetables coming from other countries\u201d.  \u201cWe don\u2019t know the full impact of the situation yet, but my friends in Malaysia, the suppliers, say the supply coming into Singapore will not be affected,\u201d he added, though he noted things could change later.  - Additional reporting by Linette Lai, Fabian Koh, Tee Zhuo","54":"SINGAPORE - While the global coronavirus pandemic has provoked fear in some people, others have been making a special effort to create and post light-hearted videos about the coronavirus.  Here are 9 videos that have been making the rounds online:  1. Gloria Gaynor washing her hands to I Will Survive  Singer Gloria Gaynor parlayed her 1978 hit I Will Survive about living through a break-up into an anthem for Covid-19 prevention on video-sharing social network platform TikTok - complete with a demonstration.  2. Racism in the wizarding world  Australian news and satire television show The Feed transports the ongoing pandemic to the imaginary world of J.K. Rowling+s Harry Potter, with Asian students at Hogwarts - who are all sorted into Ravenclaw, by the way - expressing, hilariously, their bafflement at the discrimination they face from other students and the school.  The video ridicules the issue of racism in associating the virus with Chinese people. One student for instance, is told she must quarantine herself if she had returned home for the holidays - but home is Glasgow.  3. Batman cosplayer shunned  The panicked and uninformed behaviour in the early days of Covid-19 make for some comic relief in this video by actor Mark Lee+s King Kong Media Production. Cosplay enthusiast +Mr An+, for instance, laments how he is shunned as his chosen persona of Batman.  Jokes aside, the 7 minute 45 second video, posted in Mandarin with English subtitles, has a serious purpose as it debunks some of the misinformation circulating around the outbreak.  4.

Professor Mihov, 53, who is based in Singapore, was at Insead+s Asia campus in Ayer Rajah Avenue last Monday before travelling to France, where he was at the school+s Fontainebleau campus until Thursday.  He returned to Singapore on Friday, began to experience mild symptoms on Saturday and went for testing at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.  He was confirmed to have the virus on Sunday and is currently warded in isolation at a hospital.  On Sunday, Singapore announced there were 14 new cases of the coronavirus in the country, the largest single-day increase in Covid-19 cases here to date.  Of these, nine were imported cases, including Prof Mihov, who is Case 220.  +He is in a stable condition and in good spirits. In full compliance with established contact tracing procedures, all those who have been in close contact with (Prof) Mihov have been put on a mandatory leave of absence,+ Insead said.  The school added that the areas where Prof Mihov worked in prior to his diagnosis have been thoroughly disinfected, including his office, the wider dean+s office, and common areas, meeting rooms, pantry and toilets.  The school+s Asia campus will remain open as per its business continuity plan, with mandatory temperature checks and split team operations already in place.

The steps include encouraging riders to take their temperatures and letting them drop off food without having physical contact with customers.  From Tuesday (March 17), Deliveroo customers will be able to opt to pick up their food orders from a thermal bag placed on the floor while the delivery rider waits at least 1m away.  And people ordering via GrabFood can alert Grab via its feedback channels of any food delivery rider who seems unwell. Riders can do the same if they encounter customers who appear ill.  Anyone who is repeatedly flagged as showing respiratory syndromes will be asked to see a doctor and get medical clearance before they can continue using the GrabFood platform.  Many of these measures were already in place before a GrabFood rider - believed to be the first case of an infected food delivery rider here - was confirmed with Covid-19 on Friday (March 13).  Grab, which runs the largest food delivery operator in GrabFood, said: +All partners are not allowed to come in contact with the food; they are instructed not to touch or open the food containers.  +All partners are advised to measure their temperature at least twice a day, practice good hygiene and to not work if they present any forms of respiratory symptoms, or are generally feeling unwell.+  Deliveroo said it has been giving out face masks to riders at designated locations.

In addition, its riders must wash or sanitise their hands before and after shifts and have been asked to sterilise their delivery bags at least twice a day to prevent any contamination in the delivery process.  Grab and Deliveroo will provide financial support for riders who are infected by the coronavirus or have to be isolated as a precautionary measure.  Labour MP Ang Hin Kee said such financial support would help to discourage unwell people from working.  He added: +It is essential that platform operators do right by clients and riders.  +Responsible companies extend their care and concern beyond their staff and to others contracted with them.

Posting the second-strongest February sales performance in eight years, developers moved 975 private homes \u2013 up 57.3 per cent from the 620 units they sold the month before, driven by competitively-priced new projects. The latest figure is also 114 per cent higher than the 455 units developers sold in February last year.  The data excludes executive condominium (EC) units, for which there was pent-up demand, with Parc Canberra in Sembawang, the only new EC launch so far this year.  Including ECs, which are a public-private housing hybrid, developers found buyers for 1,314 units last month, up 105.3 per cent from the 640 units they sold in January and 187.5 per cent more than the 457 units sold in February last year.  \u201cWhile we remain cautiously optimistic about home sales, much would depend on the economic fallout from the (virus) outbreak and whether there are large-scale job losses, widespread retrenchments. (That) will certainly dampen housing demand,\u201d Ms Tricia Song, head of research for Singapore, Colliers International, said.  But for now, persistently low interest rates are helping to support housing demand. The US Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates to near zero and restarted its quantitative easing programme as part of emergency stimulus.  \u201cMortgage rates based on the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (Sibor), on which most home loans are priced, have come off 30-40 basis points (bps), since the first 50-bps rate cut by the Fed, and should come off further,\u201d Ms Song said.  Urban Redevelopment Authority data yesterday shows the number of units launched jumped 56 per cent to 933 in February, from 598 the previous month, and up 56.5 per cent to 596 from a year ago.  February\u2019s top sellers included new launches The M, which sold 380 of the 522-unit condo project in Bugis, and the 496-unit Parc Canberra EC, which moved 324 units.  Many buyers were drawn to The M\u2019s location near the Bugis MRT station, Bugis Junction and Suntec City. \u201cPrice quantum continued to be a driver, with 97.9 per cent of all sales in The M below $2 million,\u201d said CBRE head of research for Singapore and South-east Asia Desmond Sim.  Other top sellers included existing projects such as Treasure at Tampines (97 units), Parc Esta (53 units), Jadescape (46 units) and Parc Botannia (40 units). Ms Christine Sun, Orange Tee & Tie\u2019s head of research & consultancy, attributed the robust sales to more investors diversifying their portfolios after the recent stock market rout.

The 38-year-old Singaporean actress has postponed her marriage registration and wedding plans due to the latest measures implemented in Singapore to control the spread of Covid-19.  Wang was initially planning to register her marriage to her fiance, American-born Chinese businessman Jon Lor, in Singapore on March 31. But in a statement released on Sunday (March 15), she said: +I regret to announce that my marriage and my wedding celebrations have to be delayed due to the current Covid-19 control measures, which have made the registration impossible.+  These measures include the mandatory 14-day stay-home notice for people entering Singapore with recent travel notice to Asean countries. This includes Thailand, where the couple is currently based.  Wang+s planned wedding celebrations in the Maldives will also be postponed in the light of the situation. She explained that this is because many of Lor+s family members are based in the United States, which is also struggling to cope with Covid-19.  +The situation is indeed unfortunate but in these circumstances of love in the age of Covid-19, we all have to learn to be more resilient,+ Wang added.

The festival, slated for April 6, is celebrated by Hindus and held in honour of the Hindu god Murugan.  Devotees usually bear kavadis, pull chariots or carry milk pots, as they walk about 1.2km to seek blessings and fulfil their vows. The temple management committee at the Holy Tree Sri Balasubramaniar Temple in Yishun decided to scrap the procession this year, citing coronavirus clusters which came about at large gatherings in crowded settings, including places of worship.  The committee had discussed alternative options but found it +difficult to organise a scaled-down procession+, said temple chairman Narainasamy in a statement yesterday.+In addition, maintaining social distancing among devotees and keeping contact tracing records will be very challenging. In arriving at this decision, we took the view that the health and safety of our devotees is paramount.+  Every year, the Panguni Uthiram chariot and foot procession draws 10,000 to 15,000 devotees who gather in close proximity to one another, both along the procession route and in the temple. The procession takes place within Yishun Industrial Park A, where the temple is located.  For this year, priests will still conduct prayers on the day, but limit the number of devotees in the temple to not more than 250, said the committee.  The decision comes after the Government implemented social distancing measures on Friday as a major line of defence in the battle against the outbreak. The measures involve not having more than 250 attendees at large private functions and religious services.  Staff and priests at the temple already have their temperature checked twice daily, but from today this will also be extended to devotees who visit the temple.  The committee will also limit to 250 the number of devotees in the temple at any given time.","61":"SINGAPORE - Be prepared for the long haul and be organised. That+s the approach the Singapore Government is taking on the coronavirus, said Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.  +We should assume the worst, even if we are hoping for the best,+ he said in an interview on CNBC last Wednesday (March 11).  +You know the Singapore Government - we take things very, very seriously. We prepare for the worst. We get all our measures lined up, coordinated. We communicate with our people, people understand what we are doing.+  In the interview with CNBC presenters Sri Jegarajah and Martin Soong, Dr Balakrishnan - an eye doctor before he went into politics - also spoke about how Covid-19 and its economic aftermath is going to last +at least a year, which means anything we do needs to be sustainable and sensible for the long term+.  He also spoke about +test kit diplomacy+.  +What we need to do as a world is to share best practices, to rapidly develop test kits, vaccines, antivirals. We need to share the fruits of applied research. We need to coordinate our measures.+  Asked about the timing of the general election, he said: +You will have to ask the Prime Minister that.+  He added: +But the election is not the most important thing right now. The most important thing is that we get over this. We get over this together, and we get over this together with our neighbouring countries, our region and at the global level. This is a time to focus on delivery, on getting things done. The politics will take care of itself.+  Here is a transcript of the interview:  Presenter (Sri Jegarajah): I am very pleased to say that Vivian Balakrishnan, Singapore+s Minister for Foreign Affairs, joins us now for a CNBC exclusive interview. Minister, thank you very much for joining us today. Where do we go from here, in terms of Singapore+s response, because the number of cases has been rising? We have seen a very, very determined effort by the authorities here to contain the situation. But I am just wondering, there is a narrative now about even closing schools and raising the Dorscon (Disease Outbreak Response System Condition) level even higher. Do we need to go there?  Minister: I think we should first set it in context. This is a global phenomenon. It is all but a pandemic. You just revealed it is 113,000 cases worldwide. In fact, most of the new cases are now arising outside of China. I think the first point I want to make is that this is a global phenomenon. Maps which do not reveal any cases probably are indications of a lack of testing. So that is the first point - it is worldwide. The next point I want to make is going to sound a bit scary for financial markets. It is that this problem and its aftermath - its economic aftermath - is going to last at least a year, which means anything we do needs to be sustainable and sensible for the long term. The next point, which is worth thinking through, is that if you look at mortality rates across the world, we believe the key reason for variation is the adequacy of your healthcare systems. Which means, as long as your healthcare systems are not overwhelmed, we believe you can get mortality rates to about 1 per cent, hopefully even lower. Those are three things which you need to understand.  Sri Jegarajah: What makes you think that the situation is going to drive on for at least a year? The economic ripple effects.  Minister: Because you can see that the genie is out of the bottle. If this had been like Sars, confined to East Asia - China, Japan, Korea, Singapore - and given the kind of social and medical procedures that we could take, there was a chance for containment. Now that it has exploded, you look in East Asia, at Iran, at Italy; and watch the numbers in the United States. Unfortunately, I think the genie is out of the bottle.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Related Story Interactive: How coronavirus is spreading across the world  Sri Jegarajah: Do we have to be concerned about recession?  Minister: That is just a matter of numbers. I think you have to be concerned about a major impact because it is a global phenomenon, and it is going to last quite some time. In the case of Sars, let me speak from a medical perspective, it took us about four months to get over. It took us probably about six months for the economic impact to wear out. This time, it is going to be longer, and it is going to be all countries. You need to be psychologically prepared. If I zoom in now to Singapore, in the initial phase, it was obviously about border control - preventing the import of cases. The next phase is hard containment, which means identify, isolate, treat, keep mortality low. Beyond that, you have another phase of delay, meaning you want to ensure that the peak of the epidemic does not exceed the intensive care capacity of your systems. That means a whole host of social distancing and other measures, which by the way, have not only a social impact, but also an economic impact. All governments have to adopt the right balance for the circumstances that they confront. Then you get to mitigation. In the case of Singapore, we are continuing to maintain border controls. We are checking everyone that comes in very, very carefully. But now that we recognise that this is a global phenomenon and Singapore cannot lock itself out of the world nor can we shut down, it means from time to time, we will be importing cases. In fact, if you speak to the Chinese - and I have been in touch with them - I think they are now more worried about importation of cases into China rather than their own containment efforts locally.  Sri Jegarajah: I am glad you mentioned China. The fact that Xi Jinping is now visiting Wuhan, optically does that suggest that China is near or at an all clear?  Minister: I think when you are dealing with an epidemic of a new virus, you are never complacent about it. For both China and Singapore, we may have handled the first phase reasonably well, but we will not be complacent. You should not sound the all-clear. I think President Xi+s visit to Wuhan is part of his overall campaign to make sure that the situation is under control across the whole of China. It is an enormous effort that they have undertaken.  Presenter (Martin Soong): Minister, you mentioned that the new risk is importation now. The Costa Fortuna that was allowed to dock in Singapore yesterday with more than 2,000 passengers - walk and talk us through exactly what was done with and for the passengers to mitigate the risk of importation.  Minister: First of all, I need to tell you that Singapore was its home port. Secondly, every single passenger on board embarked on that cruise from Singapore. They have been tested and checked before they got on board. They had to come back here because it is the home port, and this is where the cruise was scheduled to end. Having said that, in an abundance of caution, we checked every single passenger. Then we accompanied them to the airport. I think by now, most of them have probably left.  Sri Jegarajah: Can I confirm that there are 60 Italian nationals on board the vessel and that they are clear?  Minister: They were all clear, they were all well before they even embarked on the cruise. I think the point about cruise ships and this virus is that if you do not maintain strict levels of discipline, hygiene and containment, ships and cruises are very dangerous. But if they started off clean and you maintain that, and you monitor that very carefully, it can be done. I am not recommending people to go on cruises right now; I am just explaining to you why it had to come back to Singapore, how we handled it, and that it can be handled safely.  Martin Soong: Singapore+s policy response to coronavirus, the execution as well, has been held up in multiple places as a model for how this should be handled by the government, and probably rightly so as well. You are, as Foreign Minister, Singapore+s face to the world, with regard to how the island is handling this crisis. Let me ask you for the people at home - 166 cases. We have noticed in the last two, three days or so, the number of confirmed infections has jumped. We are into triple digits now. How concerned should people be?  Minister: I think we should remain eternally vigilant. From time to time, a case, if it goes under the radar and someone with the virus is actively participating in social events - that person can spread. I think that is very clear. In fact, that is what has happened in this case. That is why we are taking additional precautions, as I said, on social distancing - cancelling or postponing some events, especially if it involves more senior citizens because they are more vulnerable. These measures need to be taken. The point I am trying to make is that this is going to be with us for one year. From time to time, cases will come in; and from time to time, a cluster will pop up. It is important to identify early, go into quarantine, contact trace. We can damp it down. But even when we damp down this cluster, keep a lookout for the next. We have to be in this position for quite some time. That is the point I am making.  Sri Jegarajah: It is very clear that the Government and all the agencies under the Government are not letting down their guard. They are not getting complacent in the least. But I am just wondering, Minister, do you have a working time frame as to when we can see an endpoint to the virus, to this outbreak? Because we have been hearing a lot about the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, it tends to burn itself out, it tends to die a natural death when we are talking about this virus. Does the Government have a working time frame on when that potentially could happen?  Minister: Let me speak as a doctor. This is a new virus. It is very dangerous and wishful to believe that it will behave according to previous viruses. We do not make the assumption that this will disappear in the summer months. The situation that we are in right now, there are two possibilities. One is that this becomes a global pandemic and the impact would be horrendous. The other possibility is that it becomes endemic, which means it becomes part of the background viral load in the population.  Sri Jegarajah: Do you feel it is a pandemic in all but name on a global basis?  Minister: I think we should be prepared. We should assume the worst, even if we are hoping for the best. You know the Singapore Government - we take things very, very seriously. We prepare for the worst. We get all our measures lined up, coordinated. We communicate with our people, people understand what we are doing. My main point I am leaving with you today is - be prepared for the long haul and be organised. It is not just whole-of-government, it is whole-of-nation. In fact, this is an acid test of every single country+s quality of healthcare, standard of governance and social capital. If any one of this tripod is weak, it will be exposed, and exposed quite unmercifully by this epidemic.  Martin Soong: Minister, I do not mean to put you in an uncomfortable position, but because you are Foreign Minister I am obligated to ask you about this. We have been talking this morning about how markets have come back; rebounded, and strongly. It is because they are hoping or betting that the Trump administration is going to come out with some sort of fiscal package to offset the negative impact of the coronavirus. But now, they are pricing in disappointment because a press conference promised yesterday is apparently not going to eventuate. More broadly, there is this sense that the US is almost laughably far behind in terms of preparedness to fight this virus. Is that fair?  Minister: I would not want to engage in that kind of polemic. As I said just now this is a critical, clear, and present danger to all countries. And it is a test of preparedness on all fronts - healthcare, governance and social capital. The United States has enormous resources at its disposal. It is a matter of getting it organised and delivered. So let us wait and see. And I would never count the Americans out.  Sri Jegarajah: There is a perception that Europe, now, is the new epicentre of this virus outbreak. What is your message to Singaporeans who are choosing to travel there either for business, study, leisure, or who are already there?  Minister: Well most Singaporeans who are in Italy have returned. And we are keeping tabs on every single one. In my ministry, one of our functions is to keep track of Singaporeans who go overseas and who may run into trouble. And we have given the commitment that we will leave no Singaporean behind. We are also asking everyone to eRegister so that we can communicate, we can stay in close touch. So that is the privilege of citizenship. A crisis is also a test of the value of your citizenship, of your society, and of your government. That is what we are all confronting.  Martin Soong: Minister I have to ask you this. One of your Cabinet colleagues, Lawrence Wong, this was yesterday, was talking about the possibility of closing schools in Singapore. To date, this is not a measure that the Government has decided it wants to, or needs to, undertake. Let me ask you - how close is the Government to closing schools, what would it take to trigger that kind of response?  Minister: Again, to put it in context, closing schools is just one of a suite of measures for social distancing. The key parameter for judgment is whether you need to take such extreme measures because you are worried that your infection rate will exceed your treatment capacity. It is a very dynamic thing, and we have to watch this very closely. But just to give you an idea of numbers. The latest data indicates that in 19 days, if you miss it, the number of cases will increase by a factor of 10. That is actually what happened, probably, in Europe and in Iran. In the case of Singapore, we are determined not to take our eyes off the ball. Watch out for our announcements on a daily basis because we are watching this very closely. We know how quickly things can move. It is that vigilance, quick action, coordinated action and ability to not just announce things, but to deliver it. One great advantage we have in Singapore is not just being able to deliver, but that our people do it. That social capital of trust and compliance when the chips are down in an extreme situation is absolutely crucial.  Martin Soong: You talked about the capacity to manage this crisis in terms of human resources, in terms of physical capacity as well. Hospitals, healthcare system, et cetera. We have had the number of infections jump to double digits in the last two, three days or so, and we have a number of patients in ICU also, almost double...  Minister: We have about nine, last I checked. About nine cases in ICU. It is no accident that so far, we have had zero mortality. I cannot assume that we will have zero mortality; that is not possible. If you look at the experience of China, mortality is higher in areas where you have overwhelmed your intensive care capacity. In the case of Singapore - I have spoken to the doctors on the front line, and they tell me - we have got the resources, staff, equipment. We have the bandwidth to do our best for these patients. That is the key difference. We have more than enough capacity for now, and our objective is to make sure that we always stay ahead of the curve. But let me tell you as a doctor, these are things you cannot just build up overnight. It takes years and years of investment in people, in systems, in capacity. From a foreign policy point of view, we now have test kit diplomacy. What we need to do as a world is to share best practices, to rapidly develop test kits, vaccines, antivirals. We need to share the fruits of applied research. We need to coordinate our measures. If you look globally at what is happening - in China, they are trying to reboot their economy. In Japan and Korea, they are trying to get to grips with community transmission. In Italy, it has had to adopt some possibly unthinkable measures, and to lock down the whole of Italy. And the rest of the world should be on standby, and make sure we do all that it takes to ensure that we do not overwhelm healthcare facilities.  Related Story Coronavirus: How flattening the epidemic curve will buy time and keep outbreak in check  Related Story Coronavirus: Why staying home when unwell can save lives  Sri Jegarajah: Minister, I have lived here for 20 years and I have got to say that the response; I have seen Sars, and I have seen the response here to Covid-19. It has been nothing short of remarkable and the Government is on a crisis footing. Nonetheless, I hope you do not think this a fatuous question - but is this going to affect the timing of the election?  Minister: You will have to ask the Prime Minister that. But the election is not the most important thing right now. The most important thing is that we get over this. We get over this together, and we get over this together with our neighbouring countries, our region, and at the global level. This is a time to focus on delivery, on getting things done. The politics will take care of itself.  Sri Jegarajah: Do you think that this changes the relationship between Singapore and China?  Minister: The relationship between Singapore and China is excellent. Let me give you some data for that. It is true that we were one of the first to announce some travel measures. But I can tell you that China has also told me that they understood. They understood our unique circumstances as a tiny hyper-connected, trans-shipment and travel hub - why we needed to be even more careful than others. Secondly, there has been close communication, both at the political and professional levels. The fact that China published the genome in early-January was the reason why we were also able to develop PCR test kits, which, in a nice circle, we were able to provide them when they needed some additional help. Now, we are continuing to discuss, not only overcoming the problem in the containment phase, but we are also looking beyond that. Beyond this phase, beyond this month, for the next one year - how do we reboot the economy? How do we handle a sustainable posture for travel? And how do we keep life going? There is also a fallacy that there is a trade-off between healthcare and the economy. Actually, they are both sides of the same coin. If you do not have an economy, if you do not have resources which you can devote for healthcare and keeping your society going, you then face a very sticky situation. We are working very closely with China. I can tell you our relations are excellent, based on trust, and based on a long track record of interaction.  Sri Jegarajah: Can I pick up on your point about test kit diplomacy? When you look at your neighbours and partners within the region, I am thinking specifically about Indonesia where there has been very few cases reported. Is that symptomatic of a lack of testing facilities and test kits, and is Singapore out there helping Indonesia? Are you concerned about imported cases from Indonesia? We do not really have a clear idea of the situation there.  Minister: Let us again put things in context. We have the world+s busiest land crossing. Every day 300,000 people cross between Malaysia and Singapore. Four of the world+s 10 most busy air routes are in Asean. Singapore-KL, Singapore-Jakarta, Bangkok-Jakarta, et cetera. Thirty-seven per cent of all travel within Asean is intra-Asean travel. I have told my fellow foreign ministers we are actually one hot zone. We are all in it together. I can tell you, without revealing details, that we are sharing information, we are sharing capacity, and we are coordinating our measures. We are in it together and we cannot resolve this unless the whole world, and in particular for us in our region, Asean, gets it right.  Martin Soong: So we are directing assistance to Indonesia, also to Malaysia?  Minister: We are working very closely with them both, very, very closely. It is not just a form of words to say +We are in the same boat+. This virus has shown that it does not respect passports, boundaries, politics. It is time to work together. Finger pointing, making unnecessary comments are not helpful. Let us just get on with it.  Martin Soong: I need to sneak in one final question which is totally unrelated to the coronavirus; or if not, only obliquely here. The situation that has been going on with oil - there is a price war that has erupted; Saudi Arabia, Russia. It seems as though Russia is targeting the US and US shale, which makes us wonder. The Trump administration, should it be, is it going to be, reaching out to MBS (Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman) and the Saudis - they have a more direct line there - or is it going to be - (US President Donald Trump) calls his buddy (Russian President Vladimir Putin) on the phone and goes +Look, listen, you have got to help us out here+. What happens here?  Related Story Coronavirus: Timeline of events so far  Minister: That is a profound question with many answers. Number one, the world is undergoing an energy transformation. The whole question of fossil fuels, renewables, that needs to be sorted out. Number two, the main change in fossil fuels has been the advent of shale oil and gas, and the fact that the United States is now independent, energy independent. That is a major phenomenon for which I think people have not yet completely understood the ramifications. The next point is that this virus has also brought to a head the fact that you are going to get multiple downstream impacts on the economy. First, you get the immediate fear, which immediately has an impact on tourism, hotels, retail, and the rest of it. The secondary impact is on supply chains. We did not have time to discuss it today, but supply chain disruption has got profound impact on economic growth, everywhere. The third impact is on energy. You have a demand side collapse, at least in the immediate to medium term; you have got a systemic problem, because of shale gas. Those are the challenges. My expectation is great volatility economically: equities, commodities.  Martin Soong: Minister, fantastic talking to you. Thank you so much for your time.  Minister: Thank you. All the best.","62":"SINGAPORE - National carrier Singapore Airlines (SIA) is waiving all rebooking fees for tickets issued on or before Sunday (March 15), for travel up to May 31.  Customers can cancel their existing flight itineraries and rebook their flight at a later date, for trips to be completed by March 31, 2021, the airline said on Sunday.  This comes after Singapore further tightened border restrictions and advised residents to defer all non-essential travel on Sunday.  SIA said that all rebooking fees will be waived, although a fare difference may apply for new bookings.  It will also waive change fees for all new SIA and SilkAir tickets issued from Sunday to March 31, it added.  The airline said it will continue to review its waiver policy and could extend the cut-off date beyond May 31 as it assesses the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on global air travel in the coming weeks.  Customers are urged to contact the airline for assistance only for flights departing within the next 72 hours.  This is to allow agents to focus on and assist those with urgent flight changes, SIA said.  On Saturday, SIA announced that it would be suspending flights to European cities including Milan, Barcelona, Paris, Munich and Frankfurt.

He added: +It was an initial meeting to work out what are the things we need to do, like a local manifesto, GRC manifesto, who+s in charge of what.+  He was at a Sengkang West grassroots event at Marina Barrage on Sunday.  While the slate of candidates for the new four-member GRC has not been confirmed, Dr Lam said he +assumes+ that he will stay on, alongside Mr Teo, +unless (Mr Teo) is being deployed elsewhere+.  +Of course, when the slate of candidates is confirmed, we will bring the relevant people in,+ he added.  Dr Lam, who entered politics in 2006, noted that his grassroots activists are ready for an election, and have been preparing since before the coronavirus outbreak.  +Preparations wise we are ready, but now that the EBRC has released the report saying we are part of Sengkang GRC, that requires us to work as a team.+  He said the style of preparations for the election as a GRC will be different compared to his experience helming Sengkang West, where they would +decide and then execute+.

This applies to all ActiveSG stadiums, sports halls, gyms, swimming complexes and studios, and its facilities will implement a single point of entry where possible to facilitate temperature taking and recording of visitor details.  These enhanced precautionary measures follow the latest advisory from the Ministry of Health (MOH), which contains new guidelines including deferring or cancelling ticketed events with 250 participants or more.  SportSG also urged national sports associations and its other partners to strictly follow MOH guidelines.  SportSG chief executive officer Lim Teck Yin noted that actions such as physical distancing, wiping sports equipment down after use and refraining from visiting the premises while ill are ways that Singaporeans can do their part.  +We have come up with these measures to enable socially responsible behaviour. Regulating the number of people at our facilities helps to increase personal space and allows one to adopt physical distancing,+ he added.  Regulated access to gyms will be implemented according to the size of the respective facility, with notices to be displayed and queue numbers issued if the gym is at full capacity. Programmes conducted at ActiveSG studios will also be held outdoors.  Children+s pools at ActiveSG swimming complexes will be closed until further notice, with temperature taking and visitor registration taking place at all pools.  For indoor sports halls that are shared by groups for activities like badminton and table tennis, only alternate courts will be available to limit the number of patrons within the hall and maintain some physical distance between users. Some court bookings from March 16 will be cancelled and refunded accordingly. There will be no changes to squash and tennis court bookings and usage.

In a statement on Sunday (March 15), the opposition party said it understands there is a lot of speculation and excitement over when the GE will be called due to the release of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee+s report.  +In line with past experience, the general election is usually called very soon after the report+s release,+ said the WP.  However, the party +recognises the situation facing Singapore at present is different+ and that there are worries about the spread of Covid-19 and its impact on the economy, it said, as it added that it does not want to partake in speculation.

He noted in a Facebook post that the Covid-19 outbreak will likely persist through this year, and quite possibly longer, adding that the country has two options ahead.  The first is to hope and pray that things will stabilise before the end of the Government+s term so that elections can be held under more normal circumstances.  +But we have no certainty of that,+ he said.  +Or else call elections early, knowing that we are going into a hurricane, to elect a new government with a fresh mandate and a full term ahead of it, which can work with Singaporeans on the critical tasks at hand.+  If elections have to be held before Covid-19 is over, all necessary precautions will be taken so that parties can campaign effectively and people can vote safely, he added.

All employers and employment agencies planning for their foreign domestic workers to enter Singapore will also need to obtain the MOM+s approval before the workers commence their journey.  These measures, taken in view of the rapid spread of Covid-19 worldwide, would affect both new and returning workers.  They would take effect from 11.59pm on Monday.  +The new measures take into consideration that FDWs live with families and many look after young children and the elderly,+ said the MOM.  It said all new incoming foreign domestic workers must serve their stay-home notices at an alternative accommodation (dormitories, hostels or hotels) before they can be deployed for employment.  For domestic workers returning from overseas, their employers can arrange for them to serve the notice in the employer+s residential address, or alternative accommodation.  On the entry approval for the domestic workers, the MOM said the application can be done online.  The applicant - either the employer or the employment agency - will be responsible for ensuring that the domestic worker complies with the stay-home notice.  They also have to ensure that the worker has access to a local mobile phone and remains contactable by the MOM during the 14-day period.  The ministry said that employers and agencies should ask the domestic worker not to make travel plans until approval is obtained.

But by then, they had visited 10 mosques in Singapore during their infectious period.  Congregants who visited these mosques during certain time frames may have been exposed to a Covid-19 case, said the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) in a statement on Sunday (March 15).  Covid-19 is the disease caused by the coronavirus.  The affected mosques are Masjid Al-Iman, Masjid Al-Muttaqin, Masjid Hajjah Fatimah, Masjid Hajah Rahimabi Kebun Limau, Masjid Kassim, Masjid Petempatan Melayu Sembawang, Masjid Sultan, Masjid Al-Mawaddah, Masjid Jamae (Chulia) and Masjid Al-Istiqamah.  The confirmed cases had visited these mosques at various periods of time from March 3 to 11.  Muis advises congregants who had visited these mosques to monitor their health closely for two weeks from their last visit to the affected mosque.  They should look out for fever or respiratory symptoms such as a cough, sore throat, runny nose or breathlessness, and seek medical attention promptly if they have these symptoms or feel unwell.  They should also wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit to inform the clinic doctor of their attendance at the affected activities that are linked to the confirmed Covid-19 cases, said Muis.  Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli urged Singaporeans who wish to attend similar gatherings overseas to review their plans as social distancing measures might not be strictly implemented by the organisers.  \u201cIf you do decide to go or have gone, please report yourselves to the authorities upon your return,\u201d he said in a Facebook post on Sunday, after Muis released its statement.

Members of the public should also keep to the same family physician for better continuity of care, isolate themselves at home when unwell and as advised by a doctor, wash their hands frequently with soap and water, and avoid touching their faces.

The boys, aged 17 and 18, were arrested on March 2 and 3, the police said in a statement on Saturday (March 14).  Between January and February this year, the police received multiple reports from people who were cheated by online sellers after they had paid for their items on Carousell.  The customers could not contact the sellers after paying in advance via bank transfers.  Preliminary investigations showed the duo are suspected to be involved in at least 50 cases of e-commerce scams.  The 17-year-old teenager was charged in court on March 4 with cheating, which carries a fine and jail term of up to 10 years.  Police investigations against the 18-year-old teenager are ongoing.  The police advised members of the public to be careful when making online purchases, adding that they take a serious view of those who take advantage of the current Covid-19 situation to perpetrate crimes.  Shoppers should also be rational when considering purchases and not buy items on impulse, police said, noting that scammers might use a local bank account or provide a copy of an NRIC or driver+s licence to seem genuine.

The national carrier has struggled to cope with a high number of inquiries about cancellations arising from the coronavirus outbreak, which has left some customers waiting for hours.  In a note sent to the media on Saturday (March 14), SIA said that it is experiencing an +extraordinarily high volume of customer enquiries at our customer services centres, reservation and sales offices, and social media channels+, following travel restrictions that have affected its services.  +Customers are encouraged to only contact us if their flight is departing within the next 72 hours in order for our agents to focus on and assist those with urgent flight changes,+ said SIA.  +Customers with flight dates beyond the next 72 hours are advised to reach out closer to their trip.+  The airline added that customers can also fill in an online form on its website, and an agent would get in touch with them as soon as possible.  On Saturday morning, SIA announced on Facebook that it would be suspending flights to European cities like Milan, Barcelona, Paris, Munich and Frankfurt.  This follows its move on Friday to reduce flight capacity on selected routes to the United States, following the country+s travel ban on Europe, with the exception of the United Kingdom, on Wednesday.  SIA and its subsidiary SilkAir have axed thousands of flights to countries such as India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand, due to concerns about the coronavirus.  Airlines around the world are facing dwindling travel demand amid the travel restrictions. The coronavirus outbreak has led companies to scale back on business travel and discouraged tourism.  An SIA spokesman told ST on Friday that the flight cuts announced to date would result in a 15.6 per cent reduction in capacity for both SIA and SilkAir.  Long queues have formed at its service centre at ION Orchard, and ST understands that customers have waited hours to speak to customer service agents.  SIA said that additional resources have been deployed to support its staff dealing with the surge in inquiries.  +Updates on Covid-19 travel restrictions and waiver policies can be found on the Singapore Airlines website. Customers who booked their tickets through travel agencies are advised to contact their agents for assistance,+ it said.  +Singapore Airlines apologises for the inconvenience, and deeply appreciates the patience and support of our customers during this period.+","74":"SINGAPORE - A call by the Government to observe social distancing to keep the coronavirus at bay drew mixed reactions on Saturday as many Singaporeans tried to live life as normally as they could.  Shaking off cabin fever, many emerged from their homes to do grocery shopping and eat out at shopping malls and open-air public places like hawker centres, although they were still cautious about the threat of the coronavirus and mindful that they needed to steer clear of very crowded areas.  A 40-year-old housewife who wanted to be known only as Melissa was doing some shopping for her family at Junction 8: +I avoid touristy spots and airports.  +I can+t avoid going to certain places like malls, I need to do grocery shopping... It comes to a point where you can+t stay at home. Kids get cabin fever.+  Quality control officer Ahmad Tirmuzi Bin Mazlan, 27, who was also at Junction 8 said: +I still meet my friends once or twice a week, although I am increasingly cautious about the numbers. I come home straight away after work, but I still go shopping sometimes.+  Then there were others who were unfazed.  +There are no changes to our schedule,+ said assistant manager Adrem Tan, 31, who was at children+s toys and clothes shop Kiddy Palace with his wife and three young children. +We don+t avoid going to any place. We also don+t buy masks or take any precautions.+  The comments follow stronger steps taken by the government on Friday to implement social distancing as a major line of defence.  This involves deferring or cancelling all ticketed cultural, sports and entertainment events with 250 participants or more. Large private functions and religious services should not have more than 250 attendees.  Owners and tenants of venues that are publicly accessible were also advised to take precautions where possible. These include keeping seats at least one metre apart at dining outlets, limiting the number of visitors at any one time at entertainment venues and tourist attractions such as casinos, cinemas and theme parks.  But these suggestions did not seem to be taken too seriously by residents in public spaces and malls on Saturday.  It was business as usual at lunchtime at Ikea Tampines, with patrons crowding the cafeteria without any distancing between them.

If people do that I will follow suit. Although I don+t think it will have much effect. I think it+s more important to practice personal hygiene,+ said Ms Sie.  Passengers on the free shuttle buses to Sembawang Shopping Centre were seated with no appreciable distance between them.  Popular outlets like Chic-a-boo and Burger King also did not appear to be prescribing where people should be seated, though workers were seen to be cleaning tables after every customer.  There were some people who dutifully kept a distance from other diners at Sembawang Food Centre, where operators marked out alternate seats with bright red tape - which meant that these should not be used.

A scheduled Officer Cadet Commissioning Parade proceeded as normal on Saturday (March 14), with some extra precautions because of the coronavirus situation.  A total of 227 cadets - 161 from the Army, 24 from the Navy, and 42 from the Air Force - became officers of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), following 38 weeks of rigorous training at the Officer Cadet School.  The Government announced the day before that Singapore will be taking strong steps to stop the virus from spreading within the country, using social distancing as a major line of defence.  On Saturday, the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) said in a release that compared to other past cadet commissioning parades, the number of invited guests was cut by half and the customary post-parade dinner cancelled.  +All attendees were required to undergo temperature screening and declare their travel history, reminded not to attend if they felt unwell, and provided with access to hand sanitisers,+ said Mindef.  +Attendees were also tagged to their seating arrangements in the parade square to assist contact tracing if necessary.+  The commissioning parade at the SAFTI Military Institute was reviewed by Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Masagos Zulkifli, who highlighted the importance of a strong SAF in upholding Singapore+s national interest.  He said: +The SAF, like Singapore, may be small in size, but it stands tall and proud to defend our rights and advance our national interests.  +The source of that strength lies not just in modern and sophisticated weaponry, but the heart and dedication of the people who make up the SAF.+  Noting the responsibility the newly commissioned officers have as leaders, Mr Masagos told the 227 cadets that their duty was to rally and nurture all Singaporeans regardless of their races, religions, and socioeconomic backgrounds.  +You will have to inspire them to serve with distinction and commit to the common cause of keeping Singapore safe and secure,+ he said.  The extra social distancing measures did not dampen the spirit of cadets like LTA Regina Lim, 24, who was presented with the Sword of Merit, an accolade given to the top 10 per cent of the graduating cohort.  Related Story Gan Kim Yong and Lawrence Wong sit 1m apart at Covid-19 press conference as part of social distancing  When asked how she felt to be commissioned, she said: +I feel really happy because its been a long time... everyday we do exercises that are physically taxing.  +Being able to finally commission is an honour because I have been looking forward to this day since the start of basic military training.+","76":"SINGAPORE - The release of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) report makes no comment and is not correlated to the election date, said Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Saturday (March 14).  +Our focus at this point in time is to make sure that we manage the health situation well so that the lives of Singaporeans are well taken care of,+ he said, referring to the coronavirus outbreak.  +Let+s not get ahead of ourselves,+ he added.  But Mr Chan was confident that voters would do the right thing when the time comes.  He said: +Whenever the time comes for the next general election, Singaporeans will be wise enough to make the decision as to which is the team that had been serving them consistently, which is the team that is best placed to take care of their lives and livelihoods of Singaporeans going forward.+  He was responding to the EBRC report and questions about the GE from journalists on the sidelines of an event at the Singapore zoo.  The changes to constituency boundaries announced on Friday, among other things, will see the number of elected MPs in Parliament increase by four and the end of the six-member group representation constituencies.  Single-member constituencies (SMC) Sengkang West, Fengshan and Punggol East were also removed, although the total number of SMC+s went up by one.  In 2015, the EBRC report was published on July 24 with Parliament being dissolved the following month. The election took place on Sept 11. In 2011, the report was published on Feb 24, and the election was held on May 7.  The next GE must be held by April 2021.  Opposition parties criticised the report+s release on Friday, and urged Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong not to hold the elections in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak.  Mr Chan, who is also second assistant secretary-general of the ruling People+s Action Party, said that Mr Lee will make the call on when GE will be, adding that the Government+s focus is on +creating conditions for our eventual recovery+.  He said Singapore should focus on making sure that it is one of the first countries in the world - if not the first - to +make it out of the block+ when the dust settles on the outbreak, he added.  +They are all looking at how a society, how a government responds to a situation, whether they are just tackling the here and now or are they not only tackling the here and now, but putting in place foundations for the future success of a country,+ Mr Chan said.  +And, if we do this well, if we maintain our psychological resilience, our social cohesion, the efficiency and effectiveness of us as a society, then we will truly be able to distinguish ourselves well,+ he added.  +We are focused on those things, and I think whenever the Prime Minister makes the decision, that is his prerogative, but in the meantime we stay focused on what we need to do to help fellow Singaporeans.+  He also said the Covid-19 outbreak presents both an opportunity and a challenge.  +In the past, if people just looked at the supply chain from a pure price perspective, then we might be priced out,+ Mr Chan said.  But companies are looking at fortifying their supply chains at places that are trusted hubs and allow them to have business continuity, he added.  +These actually all play to our advantage so we should capitalise on this, position ourselves well,+ he said. +But first and foremost, before we get there, we must make sure that our companies continue to survive and do well and we must make sure that the jobs of our people are sustained.+","77":"SINGAPORE - The Covid-19 outbreak could last all the way till when the next general election must be held by - April 2021 - and so it is difficult to say when it is a good time to hold it, said Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin on Saturday (March 14).  +If the situation is not going to ease off in the coming months, and before April 2021, then frankly, whether it+s now, whether it+s half a year or three-quarters of a year later, the conditions probably might be the same.  +In fact, one could think that the conditions might be worse in the coming months,+ he told The Straits Times on the sidelines of an SGSecure roadshow outside the Paya Lebar Quarter mall.  Mr Tan, who is also an MP for Marine Parade GRC, was asked for his assessment of when the next general election could be held, with the release of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee report on Friday (March 13).  He said that the situation caused by the outbreak of Covid-19 was +a fair consideration+ on when the polls could be held.  +But it (the Covid-19 situation) doesn+t appear to be a short-term issue that we are grappling with. It looks like this is going to remain with us for some time,+ he said.  Other Singapore leaders, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, have made a similar assessment with PM Lee saying on Thursday the outbreak could continue for a year or longer.  Political observers have speculated that the GE could be held as early as next month (April). Another possible period was May to June.  At the roadshow, Mr Tan was accompanied by fellow Marine Parade MP Seah Kian Peng and Mountbatten MP Lim Biow Chuan.  Former chief executive of IHH Healthcare Tan See Leng was also present. He has been spotted with Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong on a number of grassroots activities in recent months, leading to speculation that he could be a potential candidate.  Asked about the latest changes to the electoral boundaries, which include one more single-member constituency and the end of six-member GRCs, Mr Tan said that while he was not privy to the considerations that the review committee has put in place, the general move was towards greater contestability.  Related Story Singapore GE: What an election during a global pandemic might look like  Another factor, he said, was shifts in population. +Usually you would need to then relook at the boundaries and then realign, so in areas where you have new estates popping up, new population movements, invariably, boundaries need to be affected.+  As for how campaigning could be done during this period, Mr Tan said that house visits could continue, but adjustments might have to be made for rallies.  But he cautioned that it would be a mistake to see the +key work+ as revolving around the minimum nine-day campaigning period, or in the lead-up to an election.  +Frankly, if any party just depends on these couple of days of action to determine whether they gain the support of the residents, I think you have fundamentally failed.+  Asked about a possible rematch in his GRC with the Workers+ Party, which contested in 2015, Mr Tan said he did not believe it was active on the ground.  +I know that from time to time (they do outreach activities), and I know my ground, I know that (it+s done) very rarely. In fact, I+m rather surprised.  +I do block visits, I know it takes a long time to cover these carefully... But I guess it+s always good to have a choice presented to the residents.+","78":"SINGAPORE - Upcoming events including The Association of Women for Action and Research+s (Aware) concert and operations at nightclub Marquee Singapore have been deferred or cancelled in response to the evolving coronavirus situation.  Aware announced the postponement of its Superwomen In Concert 2020 on its Facebook page on Saturday (March 14).  The non-profit group said the concert scheduled for April 10 at Esplanade Concert Hall would be held on a new date in 2021.  Aware said tickets will remain valid but patrons who cannot attend the rescheduled concert can get a full refund from ApacTix by April 10.  It said that it is delaying the event +to a time when we can be more secure in our community+s health and safety - always our top priority+.  The Ministry of Health advised organisers on Friday to defer or cancel all ticketed sports, cultural and entertainment events with 250 participants or more.  Marquee Singapore said in an Instagram post on Friday that the nightclub would suspend operations until further notice and that all pre-purchased tickets for upcoming performances would be automatically refunded.  Obog Wind Symphony, which was due to perform alongside singers Jeremy Lee and Tay Ke Wei at the Singapore Botanic Gardens on Sunday, has postponed the event, noting that +public health and security is our topmost priority+.  Prime Gymnastics Club has cancelled its international gymnastic invitational competition that was scheduled for May 29 and 31.  About 480 gymnasts, including 290 local participants and 190 foreign ones, had registered for the event.","79":"SINGAPORE - The date of the next general election will depend on what will best see Singapore through the major crisis posed by the coronavirus pandemic, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.  Singapore faces grave and extended challenges, he said in a Facebook post on Saturday (March 14), noting that the Covid-19 outbreak will likely last at least this year, and quite possibly longer.  +I fully expect things to get more serious before they start getting better,+ he said, adding that Singapore has two options ahead.  The first is to hope and pray that things will stabilise before the end of the term, so that elections can be held under more normal circumstances. +But we have no certainty of that,+ he said.  +Or else call elections early, knowing that we are going into a hurricane, to elect a new government with a fresh mandate and a full term ahead of it, which can work with Singaporeans on the critical tasks at hand.+  If elections have to be held before Covid-19 is over, all necessary precautions will be taken so that parties can campaign effectively, and people can vote safely, PM Lee added.  +At stake are jobs, businesses and lives.+  The timing of the election depends on the situation and the outlook, he said.  He noted that the GE can be called only after the electoral registers are updated, which will take about a month.  The next general election has to be held before April 21, 2021.  The Prime Minister+s remarks came a day after new electoral boundaries were announced.  The release of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee+s report has prompted multiple opposition parties to call for the Government to delay the election till the coronavirus outbreak has been contained.  Associate Professor Bilveer Singh from the National University of Singapore said PM Lee\u2019s post \u201cmakes it quite clear\u201d the GE will be held very soon \u2013 within the next two months, or latest by June.  It is advantageous for the ruling party to do so, notwithstanding the Covid-19 crisis, he added, pointing to how it has won plaudits for its handling of the outbreak.  In his post, PM Lee said he held a dialogue on Saturday morning with grassroots leaders on Covid-19 and what lies ahead for Singapore.  +Fighting Covid-19 is difficult enough. But we also need to deal with Covid-19+s enormous impact on our economy,+ he said.  The economic fallout will likely be more serious than the global financial crisis, and longer-lasting too, even beyond the end of the pandemic, he added.  +Covid-19 may well turn out to be the crisis that defines this generation of Singaporeans. We must gird ourselves to overcome this together, and show the world what Singapore can do.+  With the release of the committee+s report, the next step is for Parliament to be dissolved, and the Writ of Election issued.  Nomination Day must take place at least five working days from the date of the writ.  From Nomination Day, there will be at least nine days of campaigning and one Cooling-Off Day before Singaporeans head to the polls.  In its report, the committee recommended increasing the number of elected Members of Parliament from 89 to 93.  There will be 14 Single-Member Constituencies (SMCs) and 17 Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs), up from 13 SMCs and 16 GRCs in the 2015 GE.  PM Lee+s Ang Mo Kio GRC was among the constituencies that saw changes - it will be downsized from six members to five, with Yio Chu Kang ward carved out as a single seat.  It will also take in parts of Sengkang West SMC which lie on the west side of Sungei Punggol.  The rest of the single-seat will be merged into a new four-member Sengkang GRC, along with Punggol East SMC and parts of Pasir-Ris Punggol GRC.  In all, just over 13 per cent of voters will find themselves in a new constituency, compared with the 19 per cent of voters affected by boundary changes ahead of the 2015 election.  Former People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) MP Inderjit Singh noted that if the ruling party waits too long, it could face a situation where the polls have to be held when the outbreak is more severe than it is now.  And the Government\u2019s assessment is that things will likely get worse, he said. So the thinking is to quickly hold the election and put a strong government in place with a new five-year term to tackle the fallout from Covid-19, he added.  \u201cFrom the PAP\u2019s perspective, this is the best time (to have an election),\u201d he said. \u201cWhen people have a siege mentality, they will go for safety and a proven government.\u201d","80":"SINGAPORE - Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) secretary-general Chee Soon Juan has urged the Government not to hold the general election until +there are clear signs+ that the coronavirus outbreak has been contained or has abated.  With the electoral boundaries report released on Friday (March 13), there are expectations the next poll could be held soon.  Dr Chee said it would be +socially irresponsible+ to proceed with it given that the outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation.  Speaking to reporters outside the Bloodbank @ Dhoby Ghaut on Saturday morning (March 14), Dr Chee, who was flanked by senior party members, said: +A couple of weeks ago, we were down to one, two, three, zero cases (of new infections) I saw on one day. And all of a sudden, because of the Jurong cluster, we had things bouncing right back up again.+  On March 9, it was reported that the Safra Jurong cluster, which stemmed from a dinner function, was then the largest with 36 cases.  +Now is not the time to take your eye off the ball,+ said Dr Chee, who was at the blood bank with party members to donate blood.  Unlike some scheduled international sporting events like football and motor racing, which have been postponed or cancelled, Dr Chee said there was still time to hold Singapore+s general election.  The general election must be held by April 2021.  Dr Chee said there will be major concerns if it were to proceed.  Voters would be in close proximity to others at polling stations and at rallies. Officials involved in vote counting would have to manually deal with the ballot papers, he said.  He reiterated that state resources should be focused on conquering and arresting the outbreak to allow Singaporeans to get back to normal life.  +How is all this going to play out?+ said Dr Chee. +So we don+t accept that this (general election) has to go on. And we want to maintain this line and tell the government that this is a very serious situation. If this continues to worsen, the PAP (People+s Action Party) will be held responsible for this continued outbreak.+  The SDP+s activities have also been affected by the Covid-19 outbreak. It has decided to hold off its 40th anniversary celebrations, initially planned for the end of this month.  Nevertheless, the party still continues to engage the public via social media.","81":"SINGAPORE - Singapore+s largest nightclub Marquee Singapore, located at Marina Bay Sands, is suspending operations until further notice.

It is also to +ensure the health and safety of guests and staff+.  The club added that all pre-purchased tickets to upcoming performances will be refunded automatically, and advised that updates on its re-opening will be shared via its social media platforms.  Earlier on Friday, Dutch DJ Laidback Luke cancelled his set that was due to take place later at night, citing travel restrictions imposed by the United States government.

The Straits Times understands that Zouk is continuing with operations on March 13 night with trance DJs Markus Schulz and Arkham Knights lined up.","82":"SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - Experts believe Covid-19 can be defeated without resorting to such an extreme measure with heavy costs.  It was helter-skelter after Malaysia announced a two-week national lockdown on Monday night. The disorder was not just over there but also in Singapore because of the close ties between the two countries.  Students and workers scrambled across the Causeway to beat the lockdown deadline as employers here sought lodgings for their workers.  Like China and Italy, Malaysia has taken drastic action to counter a surge in coronavirus cases, mostly linked to a mass religious event in late February.  When asked if Singapore would consider such a move, which is also in place in France and being considered in London, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong told a press conference on Tuesday that while he could not rule it out, it was not on the cards.  Observers and public health experts say the chaos that ensued after Malaysia+s lockdown showed why such a measure would be warranted only if the outbreak gets out of hand and the benefits outweigh the costs.  Dr Gillian Koh, deputy director for research at the Institute of Policy Studies, told The New Paper: +Singapore+s survival and sustainability depends on borders being open and receiving goods as well as people.  +So the cost of locking down Singapore is very high, both for the economy and for sustaining daily life itself.+  But a recent spike in the number of infections has led to online ire and frustration over people here going on holidays despite advisories to defer non-essential travel.  A record 47 new cases were reported on Wednesday, of which 30 were Singapore residents returning from abroad.  Yesterday, for the first time in five days, the number of new cases dropped, as 32 infections were confirmed, of which 24 were imported, all involving returning Singapore residents.  Arguing why a lockdown was highly unlikely, Dr Koh said: +Even with returning Singaporeans, we have very stringent protocols and all of us do expect them to abide by them... to ensure that we keep the extreme scenario of a lockdown as far away as possible.+  National University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser said it was understandable that Singaporeans felt negatively towards people they deemed socially irresponsible.  Singapore Management University law don Eugene Tan agreed but felt these sentiments would weaken after the outbreak.  Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, infectious diseases programme leader at Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at NUS, said a lockdown is a +nuclear option+ reserved for when community transmission has to be brought under control quickly.  While this seems to have worked for China, which yesterday saw zero new infections in Hubei province for the first time since the virus emerged there, Prof Hsu said lockdowns cannot be done indefinitely.  With the virus spreading in so many countries, it could also still be re-imported.  Whether an outbreak is severe enough to warrant such an extreme measure depends on how much each society can tolerate its costs, said Prof Hsu.  +Sometimes that price is far higher than what the virus can do,+ he added.  TESTING CAPACITY  Making a comparison with South Korea+s approach, which involved expanding its testing capacity rapidly and implementing strict social distancing, Prof Hsu said each country had to find the right balance and use its strengths where possible to control the outbreak.  +We are fortunate that community transmission is low at present, and there is more leeway in terms of what we can do,+ he added.  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore General Hospital to convert part of carpark into fever screening area  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam said it is thanks to the hard work put in earlier during the outbreak that a lockdown is not needed here.  Prof Hsu said what Singapore is doing now is to try to prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed at its current capacity, or what is known as flattening the curve.  But at the same time, he said Singapore can also prepare for a possible surge and try to expand healthcare capacity.  He suggested training people to take over some of the work done by nurses so they can be freed up for other tasks.  +For the regular patients... they can just be isolated in a facility where they can+t transmit the virus but can be monitored and taken care of in a way that doesn+t require the heavy resources of a hospital bed or an isolation room,+ Prof Hsu said.  Dr Leong was optimistic that Singapore could maintain its efforts in fighting the virus over the next three to six months but warned against complacency.

Singapore Flyer said that operations resumed on Friday (March 20) after getting approval from the authorities on Thursday.  A Flyer spokesman said the structural integrity of the attraction+s observation wheel has been thoroughly tested by experts, and said it is +(looking) forward to welcoming guests again+.  But it has taken some precautionary measures to allow guests to enjoy its flights and facilities \u201cwith a peace of mind\u201d.

The flight operations of the wheel were suspended by the Building and Construction Authority in Nov 19 last year due to a glitch affecting a section of the outer layer of one of the spoke cables. It gave the Singapore Flyer the go-ahead to operate again on Thursday.  The Singapore Tourism Board has said that visitor arrivals this year are expected to fall by about 25 to 30 per cent as governments across the world impose border restrictions and people choose to stay home.  When asked if this affected the Flyer\u2019s decision to restart operations, a spokesman said this forecast dip has already been taken into account.  \u201cAs one of the key players in Singapore\u2019s tourism sector, we must play our part in supporting and initiating recovery plans,\u201d she said.  During the Flyer\u2019s suspension, its tenants at the retail section continued with normal business.  The attraction, which has become an icon of the Singapore skyline since its opening in 2008, has had its fair share of troubles over the years.  In December 2008, a fire broke out in the wheel control room, causing 173 passengers to be trapped for about six hours.  In July 2010, the ride was also shut down and more than 200 passengers were evacuated after lightning struck one of its electrical cables that supplied power to the air-conditioning systems.  Operations were suspended in January 2018 for two months due to a \u201ctechnical issue\u201d.

His Facebook post on Sunday came after Singapore announced it would bar all short-term visitors from entering or transiting through the country from 11.59pm on Monday, to reduce the risk of imported coronavirus cases.  Said Mr Ong: +Part of the reason for the tougher border measures is to ensure we keep Singapore as safe as possible, so that daily activities, like going to work, eating out and attending school, can go on.+  He noted that he has received many e-mails and messages from parents, with some asking why the March holidays were not extended, especially given the rising numbers of imported Covid-19 cases and impending border closures.  Others, including several students, urged the Ministry of Education (MOE) to keep schools open, as they would like to go to school, he added.  Setting out MOE+s thinking on the matter, he said Covid-19 does not affect the young as much as it does adults - echoing remarks made by Professor Dale Fisher, chair of the World Health Organisation\u2019s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.  +Neither is there evidence to show that the young are vectors or spreaders of the virus,+ he said. +The reverse appears to be the case, where the young get infected by adults at home.+  None of the students in Singapore who contracted Covid-19 caught it from school, he added.  +In this context, it may not be a bad idea for our children to spend the bulk of their day in school, where lessons and activities are arranged such that they mingle only with their classmates, who are less susceptible to the virus than adults,+ Mr Ong said.  +They will be quite a resilient group. If we close schools, many will not stay home, but may run around in the community and mingle with a lot more people, exposing themselves to more risk.+  The minister also said closing schools would also disrupt the lives of many people, particularly parents who are both working, and who have limited childcare options.  +We are particularly concerned about parents who are healthcare workers and providers of essential services.+  Related Story Children less likely to be sick from Covid-19: Professor  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Various measures will help keep students safe, he said, pointing to the Government+s existing leave of absence and stay-home notice policy, as well as checks on people+s travel history at school gates, which will be done as an extra precaution.  Students will also only spend their time with those in their classes, with co-curricular activities suspended for two weeks.  They will sit apart in class and be reminded to wash their hands regularly and avoid touching their faces.  Those who are not feeling well - be it with a cough or sore throat - will be placed in an isolation room or sent home, he added.  +Implemented together, these measures will serve as a robust layer of system defence, complementing the natural defence children may already have, to enable school to continue,+ he said.","87":"Children appear to be asymptomatic or less likely to be sick from Covid-19 than adults, which is why there is no real reason to close schools for now, says Professor Dale Fisher, group director of medicine at the National University Health System and chair of the World Health Organisation+s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.  He shares more.  Q Why do children seem to be less affected by Covid-19 than adults?  A We know that there are other diseases where children are not affected as much. For instance, chicken pox is a much milder illness in children than in adults.  And a child with Hepatitis A (a viral liver disease) probably does not have symptoms, but they might have antibodies if you test them, whereas adults with Hepatitis A will develop fever and jaundice.  So, we know that children and adults have a different sort of immune system. The children could be - for reasons we do not yet understand - less likely to have symptoms.  If studies done to find out if children have antibodies to Covid-19 show that there are a lot of asymptomatic children, it will prove - but it will not tell us why - that children are getting infected but not showing symptoms.  Q Should we worry about children passing Covid-19 to the elderly?  A That is another question we do not yet know the answer to. However, if they are asymptomatic, they are less likely to do so.  In fact, a lot of the swabs that we have taken from family clusters have shown that while the parents might have had the disease and had symptoms, the children are completely well, even though they tested positive.  We have no evidence that the child in those family clusters was the first person to get it.  If you are asymptomatic, you are much less likely to spread it because you are not coughing, you are not making the droplets. Is it theoretically possible to spread it if you share a pair of chopsticks, for instance? We think it is probably theoretically possible, but it is certainly not a major driver of the outbreak. The money is on people with symptoms spreading the disease before they are diagnosed and isolated.  It is more the other way around - the parents have infected the child and the child is asymptomatic, but you can find (the virus) in their throat.  If you are asymptomatic, you are much less likely to spread it because you are not coughing, you are not making the droplets.  Is it theoretically possible to spread it if you share a pair of chopsticks, for instance?  We think it is probably theoretically possible, but it is certainly not a major driver of the outbreak.  The money is on people with symptoms spreading the disease before they are diagnosed and isolated.  So, if that period is a week, they are going to spread it a lot. If it is two days, they will not spread it so much.  If it is two days where they stayed home because they were not feeling well, then they will spread the disease to even fewer people, or to no one.  We know that younger people are unlikely to get serious illness, but they can be an important part of transmission and every young person in Singapore has parents and grandparents who are older.  Everyone needs to pull together to do their part, to help save lives.","88":"SINGAPORE - More than 4,000 people in Singapore have been infected with dengue fever this year - double the number of cases reported for the same period in 2019.  The surge in cases, ahead of the traditional peak dengue season between June and October, has been fuelled by several factors - the rise of a less common dengue virus serotype, as well as warmer temperatures and more rain which have caused the population of the Aedes aegypti mosquito to multiply.  +This unusually high number of cases outside the typical peak dengue period is a cause for concern for all of us. Entering the warmer months of the year, there could be more instances of transmission,+ said Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli at the launch of the National Dengue Prevention Campaign in Ang Mo Kio on Sunday (March 22).  The National Environment Agency+s (NEA) annual campaign typically begins in April or May, but was started earlier this year in view of the grimmer dengue outlook.  The island has seen 300 to 400 new cases a week since the start of the year. There are now about 100 active dengue clusters across the island, including 28 +red+ clusters which have at least 10 cases of the mosquito-transmitted virus. Parts of Jurong West and Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 are within these high-risk areas.  Dengue fever is caused by four different virus serotypes, or strains. Outbreaks here tend to be caused by the DENV-1 serotype as well as DENV-2, the main dengue virus serotype in the island since 2016.  But DENV-3 infections have been rising in the past four months. In February, they made up 48 per cent of cases, almost double the 26 per cent for DENV-2 cases.  Mr Masagos said that since Singapore has not had a dengue outbreak driven by DENV-3 in almost three decades, the population+s immunity to this particular serotype is lower.  It is +still too early+ to tell if there has been a switch of predominant dengue virus type, and the NEA is monitoring the situation closely, he added.  Related Story Dengue outbreak possible with rise of DenV-3, a virus type not dominant in more than 30 years  Related Story NEA boosts dengue fight with new mozzie breeding facility  +We have a less common dengue virus serotype emerging and lower immunity against it, and second, we have more Aedes mosquitoes carrying this virus. This has resulted in a higher number of dengue cases, which in turn increases the chances of dengue transmission. So that is the third reason for the surge in dengue cases we are seeing...+  +If the three factors I mentioned persist, this number could rise beyond the historical weekly peak of 891 cases recorded in July 2014, during the peak season.+  Dengue fever, which can cause a very high fever, severe headache and joint and muscle pains, claimed 20 lives last year.  The NEA has been taking steps to fight dengue, Mr Masagos said.  From January to February, it conducted 161,000 inspections in public areas and housing estates and discovered about 3,200 mosquito breeding habitats, most of which were in people+s homes.  At the start of the year, the environment agency also laid 14,000 Gravitraps in newly completed Housing Board blocks and landed housing estates. More than 64,000 of these devices islandwide trap adult female Aedes mosquitoes that are looking for places to lay their eggs, and also stop young mosquitoes in these traps from emerging.  +With better surveillance and analytics capabilities,+ Mr Masagos added, +we have observed a 90 per cent increase in the detection rate of Aedes larval habitats found in homes for the past three years.+  But everyone must continue to do their part to keep the community safe, he said.  +In some of the large dengue clusters, NEA had detected repeated mosquito breeding in the same homes despite giving multiple alerts to residents. I therefore appeal to residents to do your part to remove potential breeding habitats in your homes, to keep you and our communities safe.+  People are encouraged to reduce the spread of dengue - for example by ensuring that stagnant water does not gather in potential mosquito breeding areas such as flower-pot plates, pails and litter such as discarded drink cans. Aedes mosquitoes can breed in bodies of stagnant water as small as a 20-cent coin.  Over the past three years, more than 3,000 mosquito breeding habitats have been linked to containers and receptacles that were mostly discarded as litter in public areas.  Mr Masagos added that the SG Clean campaign launched last month +addresses the immediate risks from Covid-19, (but) also sets out to improve public hygiene and cleanliness for the long term+.  The NEA is also putting up posters in HDB lift lobbies to inform residents of upcoming inspections - as well as insecticide spraying - for all homes in dengue clusters.  +I ask for your cooperation with NEA officers. Let them carry out the checks and spraying in your homes. We should also inform our family, neighbours and friends about these efforts so that they are aware and lend support,+ the minister added.  Grassroots leader Eric Chua, 44, chairman of Yio Chu Kang Zone 3 RC, leads a team of volunteers who go door-to-door to raise awareness of the disease. Volunteers visit homes two times a year \u2013 and three or four times if these are in more high-risk areas.  He said: \u201cAng Mo Kio is a mature estate. There are many seniors, and some are staying alone. Sometimes it can be a bit challenging to spread the message to them as well. Youngsters have a lot of platforms for information \u2013 such as social media \u2013 but some seniors may not know the seriousness (of the situation).\u201d  He stressed the importance of taking precautions \u2013 even as public attention has been occupied by the coronavirus outbreak in Singapore.  IT technician Viknesh Jayasekaran, 34, who lives near a high-risk dengue cluster in Ang Mo Kio, takes the usual precautions \u2013 leaving pails upturned and emptying water from the plates below plant pots \u2013 even as he said he is more worried about the coronavirus.

Work pass holders and their dependants will be allowed to return to Singapore only if they work in sectors that provide essential services such as healthcare and transport.  This will also kick in at 11.59pm on Monday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a statement on Sunday.  The measures were announced a day after two patients - a 75-year-old Singaporean woman and a 64-year-old Indonesian man - died from Covid-19 due to complications. They were the first deaths the Republic has seen in the Covid-19 outbreak.  National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said at a briefing on Sunday morning that the measures to +significantly tighten+ Singapore+s borders are taken in the light of the rapidly escalating virus outbreak around the world.  Previously, except for a handful of countries, short-term visitors from elsewhere were allowed to come into Singapore but were issued a 14-day stay-home notice (SHN) upon arrival.  This meant, however, that resources were being expended to serve and enforce SHNs on them, and if they fell ill, to provide them with medical treatment. On Saturday, there were still 533 short-term visitors arriving in Singapore.  To date, there are more than 260,000 Covid-19 cases across 185 countries, and around 11,200 deaths.  The MOH said that in Singapore, almost 80 per cent of new Covid-19 cases over the past three days were imported, most of them Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning home from abroad.  These imported cases had travel histories to 22 different countries.  There were 432 cases of coronavirus patients in Singapore as of Saturday evening. A total of 140 cases have fully recovered. Of the 290 patients still in hospital, most are stable or improving, but 14 are in critical care.  On the limited entry for work pass holders and their dependants, the Manpower Ministry will allow this only for those in essential services.  On what constitutes essential services, Mr Wong said the Ministry of Manpower will continue to approve applications for the workers to come back according to existing rules, with inputs from relevant government agencies when needed.  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore residents who travel overseas may face consequences as Govt ramps up border controls  He added that foreign domestic helpers could also be considered as offering essential services, especially in cases where they are needed to help look after children or the elderly.  As previously announced, all Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders returning will continue to be issued a 14-day SHN.  In addition, Malaysians with Singapore work permits can continue to work in the Republic during this period, with accommodation arrangements.  Transport of goods between both countries will also be facilitated, the Singapore-Malaysia Special Working Committee has agreed.  Diplomats accredited and based in Singapore can continue to come in. They will also be subjected to the 14-day isolation.  On Sunday, Mr Wong said that these were very significant moves especially for a small open economy like Singapore which has always been connected to the world.  +But this is an unprecedented crisis,+ he said.  He noted that while very few short-term visitors have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, they can take up enforcement and medical resources.  +During this time, we have to focus our resources on returning Singaporeans,+ he said.  On how long these measure will remain in place, he said: +I can+t say at this stage. No one will know how long this current wave of imported cases we are experiencing will last for.+  He added: +It depends on how long the outbreak is going to continue in Europe and America, which are now the new epicentres for the virus outbreak. It (also) depends on how long more we will see returning Singaporeans coming back, so we will monitor on a day by day basis.+  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore residents who travel overseas may face consequences as Govt ramps up border controls  Mr Wong also warned that the Government is considering measures against those who choose to travel overseas despite the border control measures.  +I don+t think we can allow this to continue. We are discussing what additional measures may be needed,+ he said, adding that work pass holders who leave Singapore at this time may face the consequence of not being allowed entry later.  In recent days, most of the new patients in Singapore have been imported cases, that is, returning residents and long-term pass holders with travel history to Europe, North America, South-east Asia and other parts of Asia.  Besides strict border controls, rigorous contact tracing, quarantine and home isolation, the Government has implemented safe distancing measures such as smaller crowd sizes and keeping safe spaces around individuals, especially vulnerable segments of the population like the elderly.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  For example, all events and gatherings with 250 or more participants are to be suspended until June 30, while the suspension of all social activities for seniors by government agencies will be extended for another two weeks until April 7.

In his opening remarks at the briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, he included the following health tips:  First, eat a health and nutritious diet, which helps your immune system to function properly.  Second, limit your alcohol consumption, and avoid sugary drinks.  Third, do not smoke, he said, as smoking damages your lungs and can increase your risk of developing severe disease if you become infected with Covid-19.  Fourth, exercise. WHO recommends 30 minutes of physical activity a day for adults, and one hour a day for children.  If allowed, go outside for a walk or a run, while keeping a safe distance from others.

The protocols include double-bagging the bodies before they are placed in airtight coffins.  The agency has also issued guidelines to funeral directories and parlours for additional precautionary measures at funerals and wakes. These include limiting the number of attendees to below 250 and implementing social distancing.  The guidelines have taken on more resonance following the deaths of two patients on Saturday morning (March 21 ) - a 75-year-old Singaporean woman and a 64-year-old Indonesian man - due to Covid-19 complications.  They are the first deaths Singapore has seen from the outbreak.  The guidelines on the handling of bodies were issued by NEA in consultation with the Health Ministry (MOH) on Feb 7 to relevant funeral services companies.  The agency also stated that collecting, casketing and transporting bodies for cremation or burial will be restricted to companies whose employees have undergone the basic infection control course by the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.  Funeral service company employees are to be properly protected when they carry out their work.  Funerals and wakes for those who died of Covid-19 are allowed as long as there is no contact with the body, said NEA.  +However, to minimise any risk posed by contact between potentially large number of visitors during the wake, families will be advised to keep the funeral wakes short,+ said NEA, adding that families should also abide by the latest MOH guidelines on events and gatherings involving large groups of participants at any one time.  In the light of this, NEA has also asked funeral services companies to offer other options to families, such as holding prayers just before the cremation, for example, at the service hall in Mandai Crematorium.  Burials are allowed if there are strong religious reasons for it, added NEA.  There is a list of funeral services companies that are able and willing to handle the bodies of those infected with Covid-19. Hospitals will advise affected families when such information is required, said NEA.  If the dead patient is a foreigner, families can cremate the body and transport the ashes back to their home countries. No special permit is needed to repatriate cremated ashes.  On Friday, NEA also issued advisories to funeral directories and parlours to implement additional measures at funerals and wakes, including temperature screenings, visitor registration and safe distancing measures.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  For example, gatherings in funeral or wake spaces should be limited to less than 250 people at any one time and there needs to be physical spacing of at least 1m between attendees.

Singapore reported its first two deaths from the coronavirus on Saturday. On Friday, officials confirmed 40 new Covid-19 cases, bringing the total number of infected patients on the island to 385. A carpark at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) was converted on Friday to help screen patients for fever to help alleviate the load on the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.  The contents of the circular on Thursday provided guidance on the approach doctors should take when managing foreign patients holding Asean passports who are seeking specialist medical care in the country.  The circular added that specialists who feel it is necessary for a foreign patient to remain in Singapore can apply to the MOH for a waiver.  To qualify, the patient must have healthcare needs that cannot be met in his home country and be already under the specialist+s active care. The specialist must certify that delays in the treatment of the patient will lead to +serious adverse outcomes+, the circular said.  Related Story Coronavirus: Asean travellers rush to enter Singapore before border restrictions affecting them kick in  Other foreign patients who live in Asean and wish to have continued specialist care in Singapore must apply for the Asean Health Clearance (AHC) prior to their medical appointment.  They must not have visited any hospital outside Singapore 14 days before the application to be eligible for the AHC.  From Monday (March 16), the Government said that the AHC has to be submitted by all short-term visitors who are Asean nationals at least 14 to 21 days before their intended date of travel into Singapore, and should be approved by the MOH before they begin their trip to Singapore.  These approved applications will be verified by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority at the border.  However, the circular also noted that in some cases of medical emergencies involving the evacuation of Asean passport holders, the requirement for the AHC can be waived.  MOH had earlier announced that all travellers entering the Republic from 11.59pm on Friday (March 20) will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice.  Short-term visitors who arrive in the country without the necessary approval, or proof of the place where they will serve their 14-day stay-home notice, or do not meet prevailing entry requirements, will be unable to enter Singapore.","96":"SINGAPORE - Singaporean John Png, 44, is glad he stayed put in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus pandemic erupted.

Besides strict border controls, rigorous contact tracing, quarantine and home isolation, the Government has implemented safe distancing measures such as smaller crowd sizes and the need to keep a safe space around individuals, especially vulnerable segments of the population like the elderly.  For example, all events and gatherings with 250 or more participants are to be suspended until June 30, while the suspension of all social activities for seniors by government agencies will be extended for another two weeks until April 7.","99":"SINGAPORE - The Singapore edition of Sneaker Con, which was set to take place in Marina Bay Sands on June 20 and 21, has been postponed.

Almost all of the imported cases are returning residents and long-term pass holders, and had a travel history to Europe, North America, South-east Asia and other parts of Asia, with the largest number coming from the United Kingdom.  Of the remaining 10 cases announced on Friday which were locally transmitted, seven are linked to previous cases while three are currently unlinked.  This brings the total number of infected patients here to 385. Of these, almost half - 189 - are imported cases.  More stringent social-distancing measures to reduce local transmission of the virus were announced by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong on Friday as the authorities sought to complement previously introduced border control measures.  The latest local cluster to emerge involved the Masjid Al-Muttaqin in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, which now has three cases.  In a statement, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) said it supported the new measures.

The Ministry of Health had announced measures to reduce the risk of local transmission of the coronavirus, including requiring public venues like eateries, shops and cinemas to keep patrons at least 1m apart.  Though the measures were to be rolled out progressively from Saturday, preparations had already begun at several businesses.  Casual restaurant chain Collin+s has already moved out around 10 per cent of its tables in its Nex shopping mall outlet to ensure adequate spacing between groups of diners.  Mr Jonathan Lim, 48, chief development officer at SF Group, Collin+s parent company, said: +It+s a bit of a sacrifice and dine-in business has been impacted slightly. But we try to cope by having more offers to draw customers to dine during off-peak hours.+  Chinese restaurant Soup Restaurant managing director Wong Wei Teck, 64, similarly said it started implementing the 1m safety distance and collecting diners+ details for contact tracing at two of its 15 outlets. It intends to implement the measures at all outlets by the end of next week.  +We+re a family restaurant and we frequently get big groups. It can be little bit troublesome for customers but it+s safety first,+ said Mr Wong.  Meanwhile, Koi operations project manager Lim Zhi Liang, 34, said that at outlets with self-order touchscreen kiosks, staff will space them at least 1m apart and disinfect the touchscreens every 15 to 30 minutes. Floor markers will be rolled out across all 57 outlets over the next few days.  Over at Zouk in Clarke Quay, the nightspot is limiting the capacity in each of its four venues - Zouk main room, Capital, Phuture and Redtail - to 250 people each, including staff. Guest information will also be collected for contact tracing.  Mr Seah Kian Peng, group chief executive of FairPrice Group, said that 1m floor markers at the checkout counters and storewide announcements every 30 minutes to remind customers to space themselves would be progressively implemented at all 148 FairPrice outlets. He said, however, that there are no plans at the moment to limit the number of shoppers in stores.  NEA and town councils are also in the process of marking out seats at hawker centres to guide patrons on how to practise safe distancing.  To help businesses comply with the new requirements, Enterprise Singapore, the National Environment Agency, the Singapore Food Agency and the Singapore Tourism Board issued two joint advisories on Friday with steps the firms can take.  For instance, it said retail shops may use floor markers, along with clear signage, to indicate queuing positions for fitting rooms and at cashiers.  Shops may also limit the number of people within the store and let shoppers in progressively though supermarkets are advised not to create queues outside their stores.  Food and beverage establishments were advised to reduce queues outside their outlets by taking down diners+ details and calling them when seats are available. If not possible, the 1m floor markers, with clear signage, should be used to manage the crowd.    A staff at Koi at Nex in Serangoon places a customer+s order on a designated area on the counter on March 20, 2020. ST PHOTO: NG SOR LUAN    The advisories also encouraged the use of self-checkout counters, cashless payments and mobile ordering to both speed up payment and prevent crowding at cashiers and pick-up points.  Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Chee Hong Tat, who on Friday visited some businesses in Nex mall in Serangoon that were putting safe-distancing precautions in place, said the effectiveness of the measures requires the cooperation of everyone.  +The (floor) markers may be there but the public must also get used to making some of these adjustments,+ said Mr Chee.

A government spokesman at a multi-ministry task force briefing on Friday also said no lockdown is expected in the near future.  There has been an increase in false reports posted and reposted online since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in recent months, with the Government having to make use of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act to clamp down on rumours several times.  In January, two Facebook accounts were told to make corrections to posts claiming that Woodlands MRT station was closed for disinfection because of a suspected Covid-19 case.  SPH Magazines was also asked in January to correct an online post in the HardwareZone forum that falsely claimed a man in Singapore had died from the virus infection, while The States Times Review Facebook page in the same month was instructed to correct a post that claimed Singapore had run out of face masks.","103":"SINGAPORE - A contact-tracing smartphone app has been launched to allow the local authorities to quickly track people who have been exposed to confirmed coronavirus cases.  Dubbed TraceTogether, the app is able to identify people who have been in close proximity - within 2m for at least 30 minutes - to coronavirus patients using wireless Bluetooth technology, said its developers, the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) and the Ministry of Health (MOH), on Friday (March 20).  +This is especially useful in cases where the infected persons do not know everyone whom they had been in close proximity with for an extended duration,+ said its developers.  While use of the app is not compulsory, those who use it have to turn on the Bluetooth settings in their phones for tracing to be done. They also need to enable push notifications and location permissions in the app, which is available on the Apple App Store or the Google Play store.  Should one of these users be infected, MOH will be able to quickly find out which other users they have been in close contact with, allowing for easier identification of potential cases and helping to curb the spread of the coronavirus here.  On its website, TraceTogether+s developers said the app is meant to complement current contact-tracing methods and allow for the identification of people who were in close proximity with an infected person more efficiently. There is currently no target for the number of users for the app.  In a release on Friday, the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO) said users have to give explicit consent to participate in TraceTogether, and for their mobile number and data to be used for contact tracing.  +When requested by MOH, users can send their TraceTogether logs to facilitate the contact tracing process. Up to that point, the authorities, including MOH and GovTech, have no knowledge of the user+s TraceTogether data,+ said SNDGO.  Official contact tracers will provide a code that users can match with a corresponding verification code on their app. Once authenticated, users will be given a PIN that allows submission of logs when entered.  Official contact tracers will also not ask for any personal financial details or request for the transfer of money over the phone.  When contacted by contact tracers, that is the point that users will be asked to share their data logs. If they refuse, they may be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act.  Related Story Interactive: How coronavirus is spreading across the world  On its website, TraceTogether developers said that keeping the app running all the time will not drain a phone+s battery significantly.  The only data that is collected by the Government through this app is the user+s mobile number, which is kept so that MOH can contact users quickly if they were in close proximity with an infected case.  The app also does not collect or use users+ location data, but only records who they might have been close to.  Similar apps have been said to be successful in helping to turn the tide against the coronavirus in some countries.  In highly-connected South Korea, for instance, people know quickly when a new coronavirus case is found in their neighbourhood through a government alert sent to their mobile phones. This alert includes details such as the new patient+s age, gender and travel history.    Scan the QR code to download the TraceTogether app.    The World Health Organisation and experts said that the country+s extensive tracing, testing and isolation measures have helped to significantly reduce the virus+s spread.  Over the past two weeks, the number of new cases being reported daily has dropped dramatically, from a peak of 909 cases announced on Feb 29 to 74 on March 16.","104":"SINGAPORE - The suspension of all social activities organised by government agencies for seniors will be extended for another two weeks until April 7.  This is to safeguard seniors+ well-being amid the Covid-19 outbreak, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong on Friday (March 20).  All organisers of other activities that involve physical interactions among seniors should also suspend their plans until April 7.  The move is part of a range of stricter social-distancing measures announced by Mr Gan.  +Flattening the curve will help our patients continue to get the best care that they can, and a particular group that we are concerned about is our seniors, including myself,+ said Mr Gan, who is co-chair of a government task force to fight the coronavirus.  +In addition to these safe distancing measures, we advise seniors to avoid crowded places,+ he added.  He noted that according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), individuals who are older or have underlying conditions such as heart disease or diabetes have a higher risk of severe Covid-19 infection.  The suspension applies to all activities organised by community clubs, residents+ committees, senior activity centres, active ageing hubs, Crest centres, the Health Promotion Board and ActiveSG sport centres.  National Silver Academy (NSA) courses and volunteer programmes administered by the Council for Third Age have also been suspended for the same duration.

Shanmugam on Friday (March 20).  Describing the post as +very offensive+ to the two religious communities, Mr Shanmugam said in a Facebook post that the authorities asked Facebook to disable access to the post in Singapore.  +We take a serious view of these type of statements... We highlighted how such offensive remarks have no place in multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore,+ he said.  On Wednesday, the Facebook page named NUS Atheist Society had posted an image of the Bible and the Quran, which are holy texts in Christianity and Islam respectively.  An accompanying caption read: +For use during toilet paper shortages.+  Separately on Friday, the page posted an image of what appears to be a message from Facebook sent at about 10.40am, indicating that access to the page\u2019s offending post had been limited in Singapore due to \u201clocal legal restrictions\u201d.

NUS added that it had asked Facebook to look into the account\u2019s legitimacy on Thursday, as well as last year.  \u201cFacebook has responded to say that the content on the reported site does not appear likely to confuse people as to source, sponsorship or affiliation, and they are unable to act on our report at this time,\u201d said NUS, adding that it would continue pressing Facebook to get the page to drop all references to NUS.  Before it was blocked to Singapore users, the offending post was criticised by several people on Facebook in their comments.  User Christopher Njo said the page had crossed a line with something that many people treat as holy and sacred, and said he hoped Facebook would remove the post.  +It is ignorant and insensitive people like you who cause unnecessary tensions and problems,+ he said.  Another commenter Alex Lin said the post was inciting hatred.  In a statement on its website, the Humanist Society (Singapore) said the post was \u201cneither reasoned nor compassionate\u201d and unhelpful given the ongoing Covid-19 situation, which it said affects all regardless of race or religion.  \u201cWe would like to encourage productive and rational dialogue during this crisis. We should focus on disseminating facts, providing comfort, and promoting public unity amidst the pandemic,\u201d it said.  In a post providing more information on the group dated December 2015, the page, which has about 1,000 followers, said there is no official atheist group in NUS.  It also made reference to Christopher Hitchens, the late prominent British-American intellectual who wrote, among other works, the book God Is Not Great.  The page+s Facebook post also said: \u201cWe are open to all who do not profess any belief in gods, as well as to those who are uncertain about their beliefs in the supernatural and wish to hear our side of the argument.\u201d  This is not the first time Mr Shanmugam or his ministry has taken groups professing links to NUS to task for Facebook posts on religious issues.

Related Story Lockdowns not enough to defeat coronavirus, says leading World Health Organisation expert  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Airlines worldwide have been hard hit by the coronavirus outbreak, which has led to demand for air travel plunging. This has been compounded by the growing number of travel restrictions imposed by countries worldwide.  The International Air Transport Association has said that airlines stand to lose as much as US$113 billion (S$163 billion) in revenue this year due to the pandemic.  Various countries worldwide have already shut their borders or introduced tougher border controls. Singapore also tightened its borders on Sunday, and will bar entry and transit to all short-term visitors from 11.59pm on Monday.  Transport economist Walter Theseira said the latest restriction might not be have much further impact for airlines such as Scoot and Singapore Airlines, given that demand for air travel is already almost non-existent.  Prof Theseira said: +The steady diet of news about Covid-19 spreading, border restrictions, and such has greatly dampened demand.  +So regardless of our border restrictions, demand for discretionary travel has collapsed globally.+"},"title":{"0":"Malaysians with work permits can continue working in Singapore, says MFA","1":"MOM urges firms to impose leave of absence on employees who returned from overseas between March 14 and 20","2":"Job vacancies to fall further so focus will be on saving jobs, reskilling workers: Josephine Teo","3":"How quarantine orders, stay-home notices differ","4":"Coronavirus: Services, gatherings in all Anglican churches suspended for 2 weeks","5":"Coronavirus: Singapore General Hospital to convert part of carpark into fever screening area","6":"Coronavirus: Isolation is not that bad, says infected Singaporean on his days in hospital","7":"Coronavirus: Returning to Singapore and going into 14-day isolation?
