Its construction was stuck at the fifth storey when the virus outbreak in February disrupted deliveries of building supplies from China to its main contractor, United Tec Construction.","1":"SINGAPORE - Three Facebook users, including opposition politician and lawyer Lim Tean, have been issued correction directions by the Government for alleging that the People+s Association (PA) and residents+ committees (RCs) were involved in the organisation of an event that has emerged as Singapore+s largest coronavirus cluster.  The Protection from Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) office said in a statement on Wednesday (March 18) that the deputy chairman of PA, Mr Chan Chun Sing, has initiated the latest correction order on posts about the Feb 15 Safra Jurong Chinese New Year function that has so far surfaced 47 cases of confirmed Covid-19 infections here.  All three - Mr Lim, +Henryace Ace+ and Mr Sebastian Ying - posted or shared links saying the PA and RCs were responsible for the infections linked to the event.  Mr Lim, who is the People+s Voice party chief, did so on both his pages Lim Tean and Tean Lim.  According to the government fact-checking website Factually, the posts alleging PA or RC involvement in the organisation of the Feb 15 event are +entirely false+.  It said: +PA and the RCs were not involved in the organisation of the dinner event... and were not in a position to cancel it. PA and the RCs also did not fund or publicise the dinner event.  +The event was a private dinner function organised by a singing instructor for members of her singing groups.+  This is the third time Mr Lim has been issued with an order from the Pofma office, with the first time being in December last year for a post which the Government said had implied that it was spending more on foreign students than Singaporean students.  He was also instructed to put up a correction note in January after sharing an article by website AB-TC City News that claimed five Singaporeans had contracted the coronavirus without going to China.  Related Story Fake news law: Opposition politician Lim Tean told to correct Facebook posts alleging Govt spends more on foreign than local students  Related Story Coronavirus: Government debunks fake news on closure of Woodlands MRT station  All three will need to put up a correction alongside the offending Facebook posts.  Mr Lim added the correction notice to his original post on Thursday morning, but he criticised Mr Chan for using Pofma to stifle discussion.  Meanwhile, on Wednesday evening user \u201cHenryace Ace\u201d apologised and deleted the post, while the Facebook profile of the Mr Ying can no longer be found.  This is not the first time the law has been invoked to correct statements made about the Covid-19 outbreak.  In January, two Facebook accounts were issued correction directions after they made posts claiming that Woodlands MRT station was closed for disinfection because of a suspected Covid-19 case.  SPH Magazines was also asked in January to correct an online post in the HardwareZone forum that falsely claimed a man in Singapore had died from the virus infection, while The States Times Review Facebook page in the same month was instructed to correct a post that claimed Singapore had run out of face masks.  Pofma, which gives ministers the power to act against a piece of falsehood on the Internet when it is in the public interest to do so, was passed by Parliament in May 2019 and took effect on Oct 2.","2":"SINGAPORE - Silence descended on the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints.  Gone were the crowds, the bumper-to-bumper traffic and the frenetic activity, as Malaysia+s lockdown kicked in on Wednesday morning (March 18), and the land checkpoints between Singapore and Malaysia emptied.  The Woodlands Causeway and Tuas Second Link, which usually see about 415,000 travellers daily, shut normal operations as Malaysia proceeded with its latest effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus, announced by Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin on Monday night.  From midnight, all Malaysians are barred from travelling abroad, while all foreign tourists and visitors to the country are banned.  Malaysians returning from overseas must also undergo a health inspection and self-quarantine for 14 days.  The impact of the closure, however, was felt only intermittently in food markets further inland.  Following Malaysia+s assurance that the flow of goods and cargo between both countries would continue, stall owners said they generally had no problem with receiving fresh supplies on Wednesday.  Madam Teng Mui Hong, 45, who imports chickens from Malaysia and sells them at Empress Market on Farrer Road, told The Straits Times that she noticed an increase in footfall at the market.  She said: +There was double the number of people coming in the morning but we still had enough for them.    The stretch of road on the Bukit Timah Expressway leading to the Woodlands Checkpoint is almost devoid of vehicles at 10am on March 18, 2020. ST PHOTO: ALPHONSUS CHERN    +Tell them (there is) no need to be scared, (there is) enough chicken,+ she said.  Fruit seller Teo Bee Ling, 50, said much the same.  Related Story Interactive: How coronavirus is spreading across the world  Related Story FAQ on how Malaysia+s lockdown will affect Singaporeans  He said: +People see the news and got scared. We still have enough tropical fruits from Malaysia like papayas and watermelons . We can also get fruits from other countries.+  Fishmongers, however, said that supplies on Wednesday morning were erratic, unlike vegetables, eggs, pork and chicken imports which all proceeded as usual.  A 43-year-old fishmonger, who wanted to be known only as Mr Lee, at Ghim Moh Market said he received about 30 to 40 per cent fewer fish than usual.  He said: +Some of the suppliers and their staff were not able to unload the fish here. It+s more difficult for fresh foods because we need the supply to come in on a daily basis.+  Another fishmonger at the wet market at Bukit Batok East Avenue 3 also said her supplies fell by half.  Still, Mr Lee Boon Cheow, former president of the Singapore Fish Merchants\u2019 General Association, said: \u201cWe are still getting fish from Malaysia at usual prices.  \u201cSingapore also gets its seafood from various other countries such as China and Thailand, so I\u2019m not too concerned about the lockdown.\u201d  The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) affirms that the country\u2019s food supply is not affected by Malaysia\u2019s movement control order.  It also said that based on feedback from importers, there are currently no disruptions to the country+s fish supply from Malaysia, adding that Malaysia accounts for 15 per cent of Singapore+s fish supply.  Its spokesman also said that Singapore imports food, including eggs, chicken and vegetables, from more than 170 countries and regions.  Should one source dry up, it will work with importers to tap on alternative sources and ensure food supply remains stable.  SFA has also been investing in local production to serve as a buffer when imports are disrupted.  Related Story Coronavirus: Malaysian hotel body says hotels allowed to serve existing guests during lockdown  The lockdown, imposed after Malaysia reported its first two deaths from the virus on Tuesday, is expected to last till the end of the month.  According to latest reports, there are now 673 confirmed Covid-19 cases in Malaysia.  The Covid-19 pandemic, which has infected nearly 200,000 people globally and claimed about 8,000 lives as of Wednesday morning, has upended international norms, with countries across the world imposing strict border controls and limiting their citizens+ movements.","3":"SINGAPORE - Security firms here said they will be hard hit by Malaysia+s lockdown, with around 20 to 30 per cent of all security officers hailing from across the border.  Malaysians are the only nationality, apart from Singaporeans and permanent residents, who can work here as licensed security officers.  Firms here have scrambled to persuade their Malaysian employees, most of whom commute daily across the Causeway for work, to stay - and to secure accommodation for them.  President of the Security Association Singapore Raj Joshua Thomas estimates that about 10,000 to 15,000 security officers are Malaysians, who will be cut off from Singapore by the travel ban. This makes up about one-third of the security officer workforce here, he estimated.  Malaysia announced on Monday night (March 16) that it is imposing a movement control order prohibiting Malaysians from leaving the country, as well as foreigners from entering. It will come into force at midnight on Wednesday (March 18).  Since the announcement, security firms have rushed to make arrangements for their Malaysian workforce.  Mr Robert Wiener, president of the Association of Certified Security Agencies, said firms have sent their workers home early to pack their bags and return to Singapore ahead of the midnight deadline.  Businesses are following the Ministry of Manpower+s recommendations to house workers with relatives, friends or colleagues, or in commercial properties like dormitories and hotels.  However, Mr Thomas said firms hope the rules can be relaxed to allow workers to temporarily stay in office premises with reasonable conditions. There are strict rules governing the housing of foreign employees, aimed at preventing employers from housing their employees in illegal dormitories.  +We are looking at around $25 to $30 to house a person in a dormitory, and this is high cost - it can be more than what the agency can earn per day, per officer. It doesn+t make (fiscal) sense to put them up there,+ said Mr Thomas.  Despite the high costs, firms are keen to keep their workers instead of hiring new ones, as it takes time to train and license a security officer.  Related Story Coronavirus: Malaysians scramble to prepare for lockdown after snap decision to curtail movement  Related Story Coronavirus: Malaysia govt issues FAQs on decision to restrict movement nationwide  Mr Li Xiaowen, deputy managing director of Apro Asian Protection, said his company is not looking for a +short-term fix+ by hiring, as licensing and clearance issues for security officers can be complicated.  +We are working with our customers to seek their understanding... and to help them address the more urgent needs,+ said Mr Li, who estimates that about 20 per cent of his security officers are from Malaysia.  Almost all commute across the border daily for work, and about two in three said they will take up the company+s offer of accommodation in hostels or hotels, he added.  Other companies report that their Malaysian employees are also keen on staying on.  A Certis spokesman said that less than five per cent of its total workforce decided to remain in Malaysia.  The integrated security services firm is also arranging temporary lodging for affected workers, and will provide some basic necessities and laundry services.  But firms are wary that there will still be a shortfall in manpower despite their best efforts.  Mr Thomas said it is +inevitable+ that there will be manpower shortages, and security agencies will need to streamline operations to meet security outcomes.  The firms can look at measures such as reducing patrol points to just critical ones, or even to limit the number of entry points in a building to help security officers in screening, he said.  Related Story Malaysia reports first two deaths due to coronavirus  Mr Wiener added that most clients have been understanding about the situation, and have agreed to work out a new arrangement with the security firms without pursuing additional compensation.  While the situation is bound to have a negative impact on firms in terms of costs, he said, it could also result in +a turn in the right direction+ and get firms to re-evaluate their labour-intensive processes and look into adopting more smart technology.  Said Mr Thomas: +Security is an essential service, and we really need to focus on ensuring that we do not lapse on this.+","4":"SINGAPORE - Over 10,000 Malaysians working in Singapore and affected by Malaysia+s travel ban starting Wednesday (March 18) have found accommodation in Singapore within just a few hours on Tuesday (March 17), said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo.  Malaysia on Monday (March 16) announced a movement control order that will start on Wednesday and last till March 31.  Among other things, all Malaysians will be barred from travelling abroad and there will also be a ban on all foreign tourists and visitors to the country.  The Government has given assurances that all Malaysian workers who choose to remain in Singapore will have a place to stay, and that it is providing financial help to employers.  About 100,000 Malaysians working here have no living arrangements in Singapore. They include some 1,000 nurses and other healthcare workers who make the daily commute from across the causeway to their workplaces here.  +In the few hours that we+ve been (working with them), we+ve been able to match more than 10,000 so far in the few short hours we had, so we+re confident that those affected will be able to find suitable accommodation by the end of the night,+ said Minister Josephine Teo on Tuesday, speaking at a press conference held by the multi-ministry task force on the Covid-19 virus.  +It may take some time because employers and workers have preferences, and different budgets, so we need time to match them,+ she said.  About 415,000 people, many of them Malaysians working in Singapore, use the land checkpoints between the two countries daily.  Employers have mostly been able to find accommodation options on their own, but those who have had difficulty doing so - numbering around several hundred - have approached the Ministry of Manpower, Mrs Teo added.    Long queues at the Malaysian checkpoint on March 17, 2020. ST PHOTO: CHONG JUN LIANG    Related Story Coronavirus: Hotels to accommodate Malaysian staff in guest rooms or ask them to go on leave  The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Tuesday that it is currently working with tripartite partners to help affected companies and help them find suitable accommodations.  There are a number of housing options: workers can also be encouraged to stay with relatives, friends, or colleagues. If this is not feasible, employers can consider hotels and dormitories.  A third option is rental, with the authorities rolling out a plan to help with costs, to the tune of $50 per worker, per night for 14 nights.  +Our objective is to minimise any impact on the delivery of services for our people,+ MOM said.  +We advise employers to assess their manpower needs carefully and make a considered decision as to whether they need their affected workers to remain in Singapore,+ said MOM.  +In providing assistance, we will prioritise the needs of firms that provide essential services such as healthcare, security, cleaning, waste management, facilities management, logistics and transport.+","5":"SINGAPORE - Malaysian staff who commute daily to Singapore will either be housed in guest rooms or be asked to take leave, say hotels affected by the country+s movement restriction order.  But hotels will not be left wanting in terms of manpower as occupancy rates are down due to the coronavirus.  The lockdown, which was announced on Monday (March 16), will begin on Wednesday (March 18) and last until March 31. Malaysians, including those who commute to work daily from across the Causeway, will be barred from overseas travel.  Grand Park City Hall general manager Jeane Lim said about 10 per cent of Malaysian staff, who work in roles such as housekeeping, kitchen staff and front of house, commute across the border daily.  She added that the hotel will provide free accommodation in guest rooms for these employees. As of this afternoon, three of them have accepted the offer.  Singapore hotelier Far East Hospitality, which includes properties such as Oasia Hotel Downtown and The Barracks Hotel Sentosa, will also offer accommodation to Malaysian staff who are +critical to the operations in our properties+, said chief executive Arthur Kiong.  Those who remain in Malaysia will use their annual leave. The company will supplement it with paid leave thereafter.  About 20 per cent of the group+s staff are Malaysians, with most of them working in housekeeping and banquet operations.  +Despite the last-minute surge in demand for accommodation by companies affected by the lockdown, current business volumes are still below pre-Covid-19 level. Thus, we can still comfortably cope, without having the majority of our Malaysian staff members who commute daily to Singapore,+ said Mr Kiong.  Related Story Singapore eateries largely unaffected by Malaysia+s lockdown  Smaller players have responded in similar ways. Singapore-based hotel management and booking platform RedDoorz, which operates 17 budget hotels here, will house 12 Malaysian employees at its properties such as RedDoorz Hostel @ Kallang MRT.  Meanwhile, four Malaysian employees will take paid leave until the end of the month.  +We respect their decision to stay home. Nobody wants to be apart from their families for that long,+ says vice-president of operations Adil Mubarak.  The Scarlet, a boutique hotel located in Chinatown, will go a step further. It has allocated rooms for six Malaysian employees who commute daily. Two of them will be staying with their spouses, who also work in Singapore.  Thirteen of the hotel+s 36 employees are Malaysian. The other eight stay with relatives or rent accommodation in Singapore.  General manager Fong Kah Seng said staff who live in Malaysia had time to return home and gather sufficient belongings for the next 14 days.  Related Story Coronavirus: Malaysians scramble to prepare for lockdown after snap decision to curtail movement  He added: +In the midst of Covid-19, we are trying to do the right thing by taking care of the employees and letting them know we have their backs.

All services will be suspended for an initial period of three weeks, from March 23 to at least April 15, the airline told The Straits Times.  This is a result of new government restrictions across multiple jurisdictions in recent days and subsequent unprecedented falls in travel demand, a spokesman said.  +The decision reflects responses beyond our control including a rapid decline in forward travel demand due to government containment measures, corporate travel bans and a general pullback from everyday activities across the community,+ she added.  Jetstar Asia is containing the impact as much as possible by asking staff to take paid and unpaid leave during this time, in addition to cancelling annual bonuses and the Annual Wage Supplement payment, she further said.  The airline has about 800 employees, including 500 pilots and cabin crew.  Customers impacted by the suspension will be offered a full refund in the form of a travel credit voucher.  The fastest and easiest way for customers to request a voucher is by visiting the Manage My Booking section via the website, the airline said.  Jetstar said customers should not call the contact centre as it is expecting long call wait times due to high demand.  Jetstar Asia is Singapore-owned but part of Australia+s Qantas group. Qantas, which owns 49 per cent of the Singapore budget carrier, has announced that it would cut 90 per cent of its international capacity and 60 per cent of its domestic capacity.","7":"SINGAPORE - There was a frantic rush on both sides of the Causeway on Tuesday afternoon (March 17) as drivers and pedestrians tried to beat the two-week lockdown set to be imposed by the Malaysian authorities from Wednesday.  News of the tough border controls sparked a mass exodus of Malaysian workers from Singapore to Johor Baru to collect their clothes and then rush back here so they can continue in their jobs.  The roads to the Woodlands Checkpoint were gridlocked, the congestion stretching several hundred metres down the ramp, although traffic had eased by 5.30pm.  Mr Didi Iskandar was relieved that he dodged the chaos.  The 27-year-old Malaysian cleaner was told by his bosses at 8am on Monday to go back home to collect his belongings for a two-week hotel stay in Singapore so he could continue working for his Changi North firm.  He made it back to Singapore by 1.30pm.  +I was lucky not to be caught in a long jam,+ said Mr Didi, who was taking a break on the roadside under the sweltering sun and had a big haversack and plastic bags of biscuits and snacks tied onto his motorcycle handlebar.  He said his firm will pay for his accommodation and give him an allowance of up to $200 for the two-week stay in Singapore.  +By now, those who are driving towards Johor will be queuing up with other Malaysian workers who have finished the morning shift,+ he added.  There was a steady flow of riders on Malaysia-registered motorcycles exiting the Woodlands Checkpoint between 1pm and 4pm.  Most carried haversacks, while some balanced large bags and even mini suitcases on their motorcycles.    Motorcyclists near Woodlands checkpoint carry baggage, on March 17, 2020.

It+s certainly a very extreme measure, and we don+t think we need to get there if we do all the things we have been doing, we have been advocating, and we do them well.+  Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force set up to deal with the coronavirus situation, was responding to a question on whether Singapore would consider such a measure decided on by Malaysia.  Malaysia had announced that its citizens would not be allowed to travel overseas for two weeks starting from Wednesday (March 18), as part of a slew of measures to arrest the spread of the coronavirus.  All schools, universities, and businesses there would be shut, and all public gatherings banned during this period, although essential services would continue, Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin had said.  Mr Wong said that if the multiple lines of defences that the Government has put in place - such as border controls, contact tracing, and social distancing - can be tightened, then Singapore need not reach a situation where the entire city has to be locked down.  +We could potentially do, for example... a major circuit breaker that doesn+t entail a lockdown, but entails school closures, workplace closures, and doing it on a temporary basis over a period of two to three weeks, just as the Malaysians have done.+  +So there is a whole range of measures that we have in our toolkit, and we constantly monitor the environment, the risk situation, and then we will adjust our measures,+ he added.  At the press conference, also attended by Manpower Minister Josephine Teo and Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, the authorities said it was helping companies which employ Malaysian workers, especially those that provide essential services, to find temporary accommodation in Singapore.  Mr Wong said that the land crossing with Malaysia is something that needed special consideration given the high volume of people and goods passing through.  +That+s why we+ve been discussing this matter bilaterally, but in recent days, the Malaysians, seeing the seriousness of the matter within their own country... decided that they needed a swift and urgent response.+  He said that if and when these measures are lifted by Malaysia, things cannot go back to +business as usual+.

It also advised overseas Singaporean students who have yet to return home to observe the following points:  - Take all necessary precautions, observe good personal hygiene, monitor local developments, and heed the advice of local authorities.  - eRegister at the MFA website soonest to enable MFA to contact them should the need arise. Students should also check the Ministry of Health website and MFA website for the latest measures implemented by Singapore.  - Ensure that they will have continued access to medical facilities near them, and to have appropriate health insurance coverage.  - Be prepared that these medical facilities may become overwhelmed, and may not be able to provide the same level of care and support as in Singapore.  - Be prepared to source for alternative accommodation in the event of hostel closures.  - Factor in the risks of severe disruption to travel routes and further travel advisories\/restrictions at short notice, which may affect their travel plans to return home.  - Discuss arrangements to continue their learning in Singapore with their educational institution.

I am happy where I am. Do I have to come back to Singapore?  We encourage you to return home soon. The global Covid-19 situation is very fluid and uncertain. Other than travel restrictions and reduction of services, as cases grow, there may be a strain on medical facilities. Should you fall ill, medical care may not be readily available.

He was deported from Thailand in January 2018, but was detained in London, at Singapore+s request, while en route to Canada.  The Thai government had rejected Singapore+s request to extradite Roach, as the two countries have no extradition treaty in place.  The successful extradition from Britain marks the end of a lengthy process to have Roach return to Singapore+s shores.  Singapore had to reassure the British government that he would not be caned if he were to be convicted of robbery, which is an offence that comes with mandatory caning here.  British laws prohibit the authorities from extraditing Roach without such an undertaking. The country had abolished caning for criminals in 1948.  Roach appealed multiple times to the British High Court to reverse the decision to extradite him to Singapore, said the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Attorney General+s Chambers (AGC) in a joint statement.

If employees do not have enough annual leave, employers may require them to use advance leave or take no-pay leave, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the National Trades Union Congress and the Singapore National Employers Federation said in a joint statement on Monday (March 16).  This comes in the wake of wider border restrictions as Singapore moves to reduce the risk of Covid-19 importation.  Employers should remind employees of the latest Health Ministry+s travel advisory to defer all non-essential travel plans to all countries, and also obtain a travel declaration from their workers for their upcoming overseas plans, the tripartite partners said.  In the latest border restrictions that were announced by the Government on Sunday, from 11.59pm on Monday, all travellers - including Singapore citizens, permanent residents, long-term pass holders and short-term visitors - entering Singapore with recent travel history to Asean countries, Japan, Switzerland or the United Kingdom within the last 14 days will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice.  But this will exclude Singaporeans and Malaysians using sea and land crossings with Malaysia, given the large numbers who cross these borders daily.  For employers and self-employed workers who proceed with travel plans after Sunday, they will not be eligible for the $100 daily support when affected workers serve out their mandatory stay-home requirements.  Previously on Feb 21, MOM had said that employers should not force their staff to take leave for their mandatory 14-day stay-home notice or leave of absence or risk having their work pass privileges suspended.  But in other guidelines issued on Monday, employers are also expected to provide additional paid leave for workers who proceed with work-related travel plans if necessary.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  This paid leave is to cover quarantine or self-isolation periods, any delay in return to Singapore due to flight unavailability or the need for pre-entry approval, as well as stay-home notices or leave of absence that might be required.  Employers should also accede to staff+s requests to abstain from work-related travel and not penalise them for it, the tripartite partners said.  Employers are advised to communicate and explain all policies to their workers before implementing them.","23":"SINGAPORE - The Republic has a robust multi-pronged strategy that will ensure the country does not run out of the essentials it needs, said Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Monday night (March 16).  This is on top of building up the country+s inventory of food and essential supplies, he said on Facebook.  He gave this assurance following concerns among Singaporeans over the implications of Malaysia\u2019s announcement earlier on Monday that it will restrict all movement throughout the country from Wednesday until March 31 to prevent further spread of the coronavirus within the country.  All Malaysians will be barred from travelling abroad. For those who are returning from overseas, they must undergo a health inspection and undergo self-quarantine for 14 days.  There will also be a ban on all foreign tourists and visitors.  Photos of queues at various supermarkets here on Monday evening started circulating online after Malaysia\u2019s announcement, with shoppers snapping up food products and daily necessities.  Mr Chan added that the Republic is not facing any immediate risks of running out of food or other supplies brought in by retailers.  He explained that this is because the Singapore Government has been actively working with supermarket chains such as NTUC FairPrice, Sheng Siong and Dairy Farm to increase the country+s stock of food and essential supplies over the last two months.  On ensuring the country does not run out of essentials, Mr Chan said that Singapore has local production capabilities for products such as noodles, infant milk powder and canned goods among others.  \u201cIn the event that we need to increase supply for our domestic consumption, we can ramp up quickly and easily to do so,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe have also continued to diversify our sources of essential goods, for example we get a good amount of vegetables from China and even go as far as Australia and Spain to secure our supply of eggs.\u201d  Even so, Mr Chan urged Singaporeans to continue to purchase in a responsible manner and to purchase only what they need. +Otherwise, no amount of stockpiling will be sufficient.+  On Monday night, Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced movement restrictions on the country, from Wednesday until March 31.

ST PHOTO: LINETTE LAI    Mr Muhyiddin urged Malaysia to abide by the restrictions, adding that the country+s national security council will meet daily to monitor the situation.  He also said that food and medical supplies including face masks will be sufficient.  The limits include a ban on mass gatherings, including religious, sports, social and cultural events.  With the latest development in Malaysia, Mr Chan said that businesses that employ Malaysian workers who commute between Singapore and Malaysia daily may have to activate their business continuity plans.  \u201cIf they need assistance, they should contact our economic agencies who stand ready to assist,\u201d he said, adding that Singapore will also continue to stay in touch with Malaysia, and to ensure that businesses and people are able to continue with their lives and livelihoods.  \u201cI am aware that many of these new restrictions and announcements may be quite overwhelming for many people. I ask for your continued trust and support as we work hard with all stakeholders to ensure that we get through these short-term challenges together,\u201d said Mr Chan.  For now, consumers like Madam Catherine Heng, 50, are worried about Malaysia\u2019s restrictions but also note that it lasts about two weeks.  She decided to stock up for the weekend just to be on the safe side, buying potatoes, carrots, spinach and a tray of eggs.  \u201cYou can\u2019t keep fresh vegetables for too long anyway - the only things that can keep are the potatoes and carrots,\u201d she said.  Another shopper, who only wanted to be known as Madam Ng, said she went to a FairPrice outlet in Yishun to stock up on essential supplies as she was afraid the Malaysia restrictions would result in a supply cut.  Madam Ng, who works in telecommunications, went to the supermarket with her daughter and two sons after reading about Malaysia\u2019s move, and said that among the things she bought were two 10kg bags of rice.  \u201cWhen we came at about 11pm, it was not so crowded. But the crowd suddenly grew very big,\u201d she said, adding that she will return on Tuesday to stock up on vegetables which were not available.  Mr Kelvin Sin, 38, said he rushed down to the FairPrice outlet near his Yishun home with his brother on hearing the news.  \u201cEveryone feels nervous. We are afraid we can\u2019t get supplies of things like fresh meat,\u201d he said.  Financial analyst Radhika Singh, 36, also headed to the Giant supermarket in Toa Payoh on hearing of Malaysia+s announcement and got a large tray of eggs, canned tuna, pasta and spinach. She said she needed to stock up as her three children will be eating most of their meals at home this week, as it is the school holidays.  \u201cThis should be enough for two weeks and hopefully the situation will be resolved by then,\u201d she said.  As for one owner of a food import-export firm at Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre, he was not too worried.  The owner, who wanted to be known only as Mr Chia, believes there are definitely enough stocks, in part because the market has been very slow and \u201cwe have a lot of vegetables coming from other countries\u201d.  \u201cWe don\u2019t know the full impact of the situation yet, but my friends in Malaysia, the suppliers, say the supply coming into Singapore will not be affected,\u201d he added, though he noted things could change later.  - Additional reporting by Linette Lai, Fabian Koh, Tee Zhuo","24":"SINGAPORE - While the global coronavirus pandemic has provoked fear in some people, others have been making a special effort to create and post light-hearted videos about the coronavirus.

The video ridicules the issue of racism in associating the virus with Chinese people. One student for instance, is told she must quarantine herself if she had returned home for the holidays - but home is Glasgow.  3. Batman cosplayer shunned  The panicked and uninformed behaviour in the early days of Covid-19 make for some comic relief in this video by actor Mark Lee+s King Kong Media Production. Cosplay enthusiast +Mr An+, for instance, laments how he is shunned as his chosen persona of Batman.

He returned to Singapore on Friday, began to experience mild symptoms on Saturday and went for testing at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.  He was confirmed to have the virus on Sunday and is currently warded in isolation at a hospital.  On Sunday, Singapore announced there were 14 new cases of the coronavirus in the country, the largest single-day increase in Covid-19 cases here to date.  Of these, nine were imported cases, including Prof Mihov, who is Case 220.  +He is in a stable condition and in good spirits. In full compliance with established contact tracing procedures, all those who have been in close contact with (Prof) Mihov have been put on a mandatory leave of absence,+ Insead said.

The steps include encouraging riders to take their temperatures and letting them drop off food without having physical contact with customers.  From Tuesday (March 17), Deliveroo customers will be able to opt to pick up their food orders from a thermal bag placed on the floor while the delivery rider waits at least 1m away.  And people ordering via GrabFood can alert Grab via its feedback channels of any food delivery rider who seems unwell. Riders can do the same if they encounter customers who appear ill.  Anyone who is repeatedly flagged as showing respiratory syndromes will be asked to see a doctor and get medical clearance before they can continue using the GrabFood platform.  Many of these measures were already in place before a GrabFood rider - believed to be the first case of an infected food delivery rider here - was confirmed with Covid-19 on Friday (March 13).  Grab, which runs the largest food delivery operator in GrabFood, said: +All partners are not allowed to come in contact with the food; they are instructed not to touch or open the food containers.  +All partners are advised to measure their temperature at least twice a day, practice good hygiene and to not work if they present any forms of respiratory symptoms, or are generally feeling unwell.+  Deliveroo said it has been giving out face masks to riders at designated locations.

Posting the second-strongest February sales performance in eight years, developers moved 975 private homes \u2013 up 57.3 per cent from the 620 units they sold the month before, driven by competitively-priced new projects. The latest figure is also 114 per cent higher than the 455 units developers sold in February last year.  The data excludes executive condominium (EC) units, for which there was pent-up demand, with Parc Canberra in Sembawang, the only new EC launch so far this year.  Including ECs, which are a public-private housing hybrid, developers found buyers for 1,314 units last month, up 105.3 per cent from the 640 units they sold in January and 187.5 per cent more than the 457 units sold in February last year.  \u201cWhile we remain cautiously optimistic about home sales, much would depend on the economic fallout from the (virus) outbreak and whether there are large-scale job losses, widespread retrenchments. (That) will certainly dampen housing demand,\u201d Ms Tricia Song, head of research for Singapore, Colliers International, said.  But for now, persistently low interest rates are helping to support housing demand. The US Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates to near zero and restarted its quantitative easing programme as part of emergency stimulus.  \u201cMortgage rates based on the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (Sibor), on which most home loans are priced, have come off 30-40 basis points (bps), since the first 50-bps rate cut by the Fed, and should come off further,\u201d Ms Song said.  Urban Redevelopment Authority data yesterday shows the number of units launched jumped 56 per cent to 933 in February, from 598 the previous month, and up 56.5 per cent to 596 from a year ago.  February\u2019s top sellers included new launches The M, which sold 380 of the 522-unit condo project in Bugis, and the 496-unit Parc Canberra EC, which moved 324 units.  Many buyers were drawn to The M\u2019s location near the Bugis MRT station, Bugis Junction and Suntec City. \u201cPrice quantum continued to be a driver, with 97.9 per cent of all sales in The M below $2 million,\u201d said CBRE head of research for Singapore and South-east Asia Desmond Sim.  Other top sellers included existing projects such as Treasure at Tampines (97 units), Parc Esta (53 units), Jadescape (46 units) and Parc Botannia (40 units). Ms Christine Sun, Orange Tee & Tie\u2019s head of research & consultancy, attributed the robust sales to more investors diversifying their portfolios after the recent stock market rout.

But in a statement released on Sunday (March 15), she said: +I regret to announce that my marriage and my wedding celebrations have to be delayed due to the current Covid-19 control measures, which have made the registration impossible.+  These measures include the mandatory 14-day stay-home notice for people entering Singapore with recent travel notice to Asean countries.

The festival, slated for April 6, is celebrated by Hindus and held in honour of the Hindu god Murugan.  Devotees usually bear kavadis, pull chariots or carry milk pots, as they walk about 1.2km to seek blessings and fulfil their vows. The temple management committee at the Holy Tree Sri Balasubramaniar Temple in Yishun decided to scrap the procession this year, citing coronavirus clusters which came about at large gatherings in crowded settings, including places of worship.  The committee had discussed alternative options but found it +difficult to organise a scaled-down procession+, said temple chairman Narainasamy in a statement yesterday.+In addition, maintaining social distancing among devotees and keeping contact tracing records will be very challenging. In arriving at this decision, we took the view that the health and safety of our devotees is paramount.+  Every year, the Panguni Uthiram chariot and foot procession draws 10,000 to 15,000 devotees who gather in close proximity to one another, both along the procession route and in the temple. The procession takes place within Yishun Industrial Park A, where the temple is located.  For this year, priests will still conduct prayers on the day, but limit the number of devotees in the temple to not more than 250, said the committee.  The decision comes after the Government implemented social distancing measures on Friday as a major line of defence in the battle against the outbreak. The measures involve not having more than 250 attendees at large private functions and religious services.  Staff and priests at the temple already have their temperature checked twice daily, but from today this will also be extended to devotees who visit the temple.  The committee will also limit to 250 the number of devotees in the temple at any given time.","31":"SINGAPORE - Most wholesalers and retailers received their goods from Malaysia as usual on Wednesday morning (March 18), Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said, reporting on the cross-border movement of supplies on the first day after Malaysia+s lockdown started at midnight.

We are monitoring the situation closely and are in touch with our Malaysian counterparts to ensure that food and other supplies will be able to come through to Singapore,+ Mr Chan said.  His update comes a day after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said an agreement had been worked out with Malaysia over the continued movement of cargo between both countries during the lockdown that is expected to last till the end of the month.  Malaysia+s Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced the measure to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the country on Monday night, sparking concerns among Singaporeans that regular food imports from Malaysia could be disrupted.  Singapore imports about 37 per cent of its chicken supply and 15 per cent of its fish from Malaysia, among produce like eggs, vegetables and milk.  Mr Chan said he spoke to Malaysian Minister of International Trade and Industry Azmin Ali on Wednesday afternoon.  +We both noted that it is in our mutual interest to ensure that supply chains remain robust and in working order, and agreed that we must maintain confidence in our people and businesses in order to successfully overcome the challenges posed by Covid-19,+ Mr Chan said.  He added that economic agencies are working with companies to minimise disruption to supply lines, with some companies already having activated sea and air freights to bring in sufficient supplies.  When The Straits Times visited several wet markets on Wednesday morning, stall owners generally said they had no problem receiving fresh supplies, although fishmongers in a few places said their supplies had been halved.  A 43-year-old fishmonger at Ghim Moh Market, who wanted to be known only as Mr Lee, said he received about 30 to 40 per cent fewer fish than usual.  +Some of the suppliers and their staff were not able to unload the fish here. It+s more difficult for fresh food because we need the supply to come in on a daily basis,+ he said.  Still, Mr Lee Boon Cheow, former president of the Singapore Fish Merchants\u2019 General Association, said: \u201cWe are still getting fish from Malaysia at usual prices.  \u201cSingapore also gets its seafood from various other countries such as China and Thailand, so I\u2019m not too concerned about the lockdown.\u201d  The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) affirmed that the country\u2019s food supply is not affected by Malaysia\u2019s movement control order.  It also said that based on feedback from importers, there are currently no disruptions to the country+s fish supply from Malaysia.  Its spokesman also said that Singapore imports food, including eggs, chicken and vegetables, from more than 170 countries and regions.  Should one source dry up, it will work with importers to tap on alternative sources and ensure food supply remains stable.  SFA has also been investing in local production to serve as a buffer when imports are disrupted.  In his Facebook post, Mr Chan also noted that some Malaysian workers who have decided to stay in Singapore for the next two weeks have managed to secure accommodation.

SFA has also been investing in local production to serve as a buffer when imports are disrupted.","34":"SINGAPORE - Three teenagers, aged between 16 and 18, were arrested on Tuesday (March 17) for allegedly spitting over the railing in a Bugis shopping mall.  This comes just after police said last Thursday that another three teens were arrested for a similar stunt.  The police said in a statement on Wednesday that they received a report that a male victim was on the ground floor of the shopping mall in Victoria Street when spittle falling from a higher floor of the mall landed on him.  Preliminary investigations showed that the three boys had spat over the railing from the fifth floor of the mall last Thursday, some time after 5pm.  With the help of police cameras, officers from the Central Police Division established the identities of the boys.  The teenagers are being investigated by the police for being a public nuisance.  The police said that the incident caused alarm and annoyance,in the light of the coronavirus outbreak, since infections can spread indirectly through contaminated surfaces.  The arrests come in the wake of similar incidents also involving teenagers.  Last Thursday, three other teenagers, two boys and one girl aged between 17 and 19, were arrested over a suspected spitting incident in a shopping mall in central Singapore.  Police last month also apprehended two boys aged 12 and 17 for allegedly spitting inside public lifts in Housing Board blocks.  This was after two separate reports, on Feb 23 and 25, were made when spittle was found on the mirrors and buttons inside the lifts of HDB blocks in Punggol Walk and Ang Mo Kio Street 32.

This brings the total number of cases to 313.  In line with recent trends, 33 of the new cases are imported and 30 of them involve Singapore residents returning from abroad.  The new, broader measures to contain the coronavirus come as the country braces itself for more to come.  As more Singaporeans, such as students and workers, return home, the country has to be mentally prepared that numbers could remain high in the coming days, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force set up to deal with the outbreak.  The rise in number of infected cases on Wednesday and in recent days was a cause of concern for all, he noted during a press conference on Wednesday.  \u201cWe cannot afford to take further risks if the number of imported cases continue to rise. That is why we\u2019re imposing additional border controls and travel restrictions today.\u201d  So for outgoing residents, the advisory had been raised from stopping non-essential travel to defer all travel.  As for those returning, he added: +This means a Singaporean coming back from anywhere in the world will have to serve a full 14-day self-isolation period.  The extension of the stay-home notice to all people arriving will take effect on Friday at 11.59pm.  New measures are being planned for social distancing among people, especially among seniors and vulnerable people in the community, to further reduce risk of local transmission.

Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Task force co-chair and Health Minister Gan Kim Yong noted that measures put in place such as physical distancing and social measures are aimed at reducing the peak case number, and spreading things out.  This is so that the health system has sufficient capacity for the cases, and to preserve as much buffer capacity as possible, he explained.  +By deferring the peak, it also means that the outbreak might last longer and instead of everyone coming down with Covid-19, we will have to stretch it out.  +We have to be prepared for that,+ he said.  He added: +It+s important to bear in mind that (while) we have planned for it, we must never be complacent and take it for granted.  +We must do all we can and aim to reduce the total number of cases so that our healthcare system can still manage them.+  LISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST","36":"SINGAPORE - Singaporeans and residents returning to the country will all have to serve a 14-day stay-home notice (SHN).  The move, which took effect on March 20, was among new measures announced to contain the spread of coronavirus cases. To date, Singapore has reported a total of 313 cases.  Here+s what you need to know about SHN, based on the Ministry of Health advisory:  1. Am I under quarantine orders if I am on SHN?  No, you are not under quarantine orders and are not required to have a dedicated room and toilet if this is not feasible. However, you should remain in your place of residence at all times during the 14-day period.  2. What is the difference between leave of absence and SHN?  People taking leave of absence are allowed to leave their place of residence to purchase daily necessities or to attend to important personal matters.  Those issued a SHN should remain in their place of residence at all times during the 14-day period.  3. Can my family members continue to stay with me during this time? Are they at risk of infection?  Your family members may continue to live with you. However, you and your family should observe good personal hygiene practices. If you become unwell, avoid contact with your family members and seek medical attention immediately.  4. My family members\/flatmates\/tenants have just returned from one of the affected areas. Can I still carry on with my daily activities, such as going to work or school?  Yes, the SHN applies only to individuals who are served the notice. Nonetheless, you should continue to monitor your health, observe good personal hygiene and seek medical attention if unwell.  5. Do I need to declare to my employers\/schools that I am on SHN?  Those who have returned from the affected areas are advised to inform their employers or schools that they are on SHN. This is so that your employer or school can provide the necessary assistance to facilitate your SHN.  6. If I am delivering food\/supplies to a person under SHN, should I wear a mask or other protective equipment to protect myself?  There is no need for masks or other protective equipment. The delivery can be conducted in such a way as to minimise contact with the person under SHN. The SHN is a precautionary measure and persons under SHN are not close contacts of confirmed cases.  7. Can I send my employees\/students to the doctor to get tested at the end of the 14-day period so that they can be cleared to come back to work\/return to school?  It is not useful to send persons who do not have symptoms to the doctor\/hospital for testing. Such individuals will not be offered diagnostic testing, and will be asked to return home.  8. What if I do not comply with the SHN?  If you fail to comply with the SHN, you may face the following penalties, as you have put the well-being of the wider community at risk:  a. You may be prosecuted under Section 21A of the Infectious Diseases Act.  b. If you are a Singapore permanent resident, long-term-visit pass holder, dependant+s pass holder, or student+s pass holder, your re-entry permit or passes may be revoked or the validity shortened.  c. If you are a foreign employee issued with a work pass, your work pass may be revoked.  d. If your child\/ward is a full-time student attending a pre-school, school or other educational institution in Singapore, your child\/ward might be subjected to disciplinary action, including suspension or dismissal.  For foreign students, this may include the cancellation of your child+s\/ward+s student+s pass or dependant+s pass.  9. What if I require medical attention while on SHN?  For life-threatening cases such as cardiac arrest, active seizures, breathlessness, major traumas and stroke, please call 995 directly for assistance.  For non-emergencies (such as cough or fever, follow-up visits for chronic conditions, refilling of prescription, etc):  a. For Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders, you may contact the People+s Association (PA) at 6344-8222. PA will assist you to make the necessary arrangements with the nearest Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC) or GP clinic, or to arrange for a house call by a GP (for those with mobility issues).  Please inform the staff and doctor of your travel history and that you have been issued an SHN.  b. For students\/pre-school students, you can seek assistance from your school or MOE\/ECDA.  c. For foreign employees issued with a work pass, you should contact your employer.  10. If I am worried about my status (whether or not I am infected), can I go to a hospital or the National Centre for Infectious Diseases to get tested?  Diagnostic testing is available for symptomatic individuals who are admitted to hospital on suspicion of infection. If you develop a fever, cough or breathlessness, or are feeling unwell, you should seek medical attention. Your doctor will assess and refer you to the hospital if necessary.

Non-Covid patients could also be transferred to private hospitals to free up capacity at public hospitals, he said.  +There are various plans for us to expand the capacity. Today I visited Tan Tock Seng Hospital and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. They have contingency plans to turn normal wards into isolation wards,+ Mr Gan said.  There are also plans +to convert some of our quarantine facilities for the less severe cases, including those recovering from Covid 19. We just want to make sure they are safe+, he said.  Singapore announced 47 new cases on Wednesday, an record single-day high here that brings the total number of cases to 313.  Mr Gan outlined the plans when asked, during a press conference, if Singapore+s healthcare system was close to hitting the limit of its capacity.  The co-chair of a government task force to fight the coronavirus, Mr Gan said that Singapore still had sufficient buffer to cope with the increase in the number of new patients.  He emphasised that any adjustments made to Singapore+s strategy to deal with the virus would have to be progressive and gradual.  He said: +We have a few options. Currently, close to 80 per cent of the cases we see that do not need much support or medical attention are kept in hospitals for various reasons such as for isolation purposes... the bulk of these can be housed elsewhere.+  +One possibility is to look at some long-term care facilities that come with sufficient safeguards because they are medical facilities, or converting quarantine facilities that can provide minimal medical care, including swabs and some attention to medical needs,+ Mr Gan said.  He added that arrangements can be made to move patients back to hospitals nearby if their conditions worsen.  Mr Gan said there is also collaboration with private hospitals +to see if we can send some non-Covid patients to them+.  He added: +We already have ongoing collaborations. Some of these can be stepped up so that we can preserve capacity in our public hospitals. Some private hospitals also are equipped to handle Covid patients....We must underline emphasis on one healthcare system.+  Even as various options are being considered, Singapore must not be complacent, the Health Minister stressed.  Mr Gan said: +I still need to emphasise that although we have a buffer and there are plans to expand this buffer, we must do all we can to reduce the number of new cases and flatten the curve.+","38":"SINGAPORE - Schools and kindergartens will reopen next Monday (March 23) as planned, but with stricter measures to prevent the coronavirus being spread by those who had returned from trips abroad during the holidays.  Students and staff members of schools, pre-schools and student care centres will be given 14-day leave of absence if they returned from overseas on or after March 14.  The date of their return to Singapore will be taken as Day Zero of the 14 days.  The moves comes amid a recent spike in the number of imported cases. Eight out of 10 of Singapore\u2019s imported cases of Covid-19 have come in the last nine days.  The decision to reopen schools and pre-schools came amid speculation that the one-week school holidays which began on March 14 might be extended, especially after the number of new infections reached a new high of 47 on Wednesday.  Instead, additional precautionary measures will be put in place.  Students who will have to miss classes will be supported through home-based learning.  Parents will have to take their own leave should they need to care for their children on leave of absence but the ministries encouraged employers to provide flexible work arrangements.  Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said in a Facebook post on Thursday that \u201cthousands of our students and their families have travelled overseas and have returned, or are now making their way back\u201d.  \u201cOur priority must be to protect the education system and keeping students safe.

The outbreak would have hit its peak by July, after which the number of infections here would start going down, said Associate Professor Alexander Cook, vice-dean for research at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.","40":"SINGAPORE - A virus may be detectable on a surface days after a patient leaves behind traces, but this does not necessarily mean it is still infectious, experts say.  This is because most detection methods are picking up the presence of the viral genetic material, which may linger for days even after the structure of the virus itself is broken.  An intact structure is needed for a virus to infect a host, such as a human, said Professor Wang Linfa, director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Medical School.  +Currently, the only way we can detect (the presence of the virus) is through its nucleic acid material, and this may or may not mean that we still have a live virus,+ he told The Straits Times.  +This is why hygiene is very important, because disinfectants and soap can get rid of live viruses that are transmissible.+  His points clarify a study by the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which was published on Monday (March 23).  In the study, the CDC said that the genetic material of the coronavirus could be detected on surfaces in the cabins of infected passengers on board a cruise ship for up to 17 days after cabins were vacated, but before disinfection procedures had been conducted.  Prof Wang is not the only expert to weigh in on the study.  Dr Michael Mina, a physician and Assistant Professor in Immunology and Infectious Diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said on Twitter that the CDC findings did not did not show that the virus causing Covid-19 could survive for more than 17 days on a surface.  +(It just shows) that the viral RNA is detectable for at least 17 days,+ he said.  +That+s like saying that detecting DNA on a piece of hair post-mortem means (the) person is alive.+  HOW VIRUSES WORK  Under a microscope, coronaviruses like the one causing the Covid-19 disease appear spherical, with a +crown+ of spikes on their surface.  In its centre, encased in a lipid membrane, is its genetic material: a single-strand RNA genome.  For it to infect its host, this structure has to be intact, said Prof Wang.  Various measures, such as exposing the virus to heat or through the use of disinfectants, break this structure, rendering the virus impotent and incapable of infecting its host.  For instance, the spikes on the virus+ surface are susceptible to being destroyed, or denatured, by heat or the sun+s ultra-violet rays. When these spikes are destroyed, viruses lose their ability to latch on to a human host cell.  Similarly, disinfectants and alcohol-based sanitisers help to make a virus unviable by breaking the membrane.  Prof Wang said current tests for the virus make use of a molecular biology process known as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which helps to determine if the sample contains any detectable genetic material of the coronavirus.  Related Story Interactive: What we know so far about the coronavirus  He said: +The PCR test zooms into the genetic material. So we have to differentiate between a live virus, which has an intact structure, with its lipid membrane intact, that can transmit and cause disease, versus a situation where you have only a little bit of genetic material left.+  He added: +In the latter, we can still get a PCR positive, but the virus is gone.+  LISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST","41":"SINGAPORE - The National University of Singapore (NUS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the Singapore Management University (SMU) are letting students write off their grades for modules this semester, to ease anxieties about disruptions to learning amid the coronavirus outbreak.  NUS is allowing undergraduates to exercise the Satisfactory\/Unsatisfactory (S\/U) option for up to 10 modular credits for any module taken this semester.  This translates to about two typical modules, and excludes final-year projects, honours theses and equivalent modules.  The S\/U option allows a student to take a course and attain the modular credits for graduation, without receiving a letter grade.  NTU and SMU will also let undergraduates use the S\/U option, but for all courses this semester.  In an e-mail to students on Thursday (March 26), SMU provost Timothy Clark said that all classes and examinations will also be moved online. Alternative assessments may replace some exams, he added.  Professor Clark said that students will be able to see their results before having to decide if they would like to turn some, or all, of their courses into Pass\/Fail.  But \u201cthis is subject to a minimum of 21 graded credits required for graduation, as per current policy\u201d, he added.  SMU students typically take 4 to 4.5 credits each semester.  Said Professor Clark: \u201cWe are mindful that the measures should not dilute the professional standing of our students as this would have knock-on effects in employability... With these changes, we hope to alleviate your concerns and that you will be able to focus better on your studies and make the best of your learning opportunities.\u201d  In the light of the Covid-19 situation, NUS and NTU had moved large lectures and some assessments online.

NUS provost Ho Teck Hua told students in an e-mail on Wednesday: +The Covid-19 pandemic continues to impact Singapore and the NUS community. We understand the additional stress this has caused you over the course of this semester.+  The 10 S\/U modular credits are on top of the grade-free first year that NUS students already have.  +We hope that this change in the university+s S\/U policy, made in close consultation with NUS Students+ Union, will help you get more out of your learning experience during this difficult time,+ said Professor Ho.  Yale-NUS College, which sits within NUS, has also allowed students to exercise the S\/U option for any module taken this semester.  Professor Joanne Roberts, the college+s executive vice-president (academic affairs), said: +However, students have been cautioned to seek advice from their academic adviser that choosing such an option may impact how a future professional or graduate school views their transcript.+  The college has been closely monitoring the situation and communicating with students to understand their challenges, she said.  +As a community of learning, this means helping our students focus on learning while setting aside, as far as we can, their worries about achievement metrics,+ she added.

According to data collated by Israeli mobility app company Moovit, public transport ridership has decreased significantly in major cities around the world.  +With many residents working from home, avoiding transit to minimise their exposure to the disease, and vast changes in local transit services, the way people travel within their cities has been altered,+ the company said in a statement Wednesday (March 25).  Based on data collated from 750 million Moovit users, public transport ridership has fallen sharply since the beginning of the year when the coronavirus outbreak started to spread.  Some cities are worse off than others. Singapore, for instance, has seen its public transport ridership slip by 20 per cent since January. While modest in relation to the decrease seen in other places, the shrinkage comes on the back of a continuous rise in public transport ridership for the past several years.  Hong Kong, long seen as a sister city to Singapore when it comes to transit, saw its ridership fall by more than 40 per cent.  Italy, which is arguably the worst hit by the pandemic, has seen its commuting numbers plunge by more than 90 per cent in cities like Florence and Naples.  The United States, where the virus is starting to take a significant toll, has seen transit ridership drop by 50 per cent or more. Ridership in San Francisco for instance, has plunged by more than 70 per cent, while in New York City, it has fallen by 60 per cent.

In fact, the director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Medical School has been practising such measures long before the Government started issuing recommendations for people to keep their distance from others, so as to reduce the chances of more people being infected with the virus causing Covid-19.  For example, after visiting Wuhan in China - the first epicentre of the current outbreak - as part of a team of scientists learning more about the virus in mid-January, Prof Wang put himself on home quarantine even though there was no requirement for him to do so then.  He was a member of the emergency committee convened by the World Health Organisation that debated the organisation+s stance on the coronavirus during the early stages of the outbreak.  Even now, he is also trying to put into practice new habits - such as avoiding contact with people, even family members, and reducing time spent outside his home or laboratory.  +I haven+t hugged my daughter in two months,+ he told The Straits Times on Monday (March 23), after a panel discussion hosted by the newspaper on how people were the first line of defence against the spread of Covid-19.  Prof Wang said that life, as well as his work in the laboratory, had to go on even during an outbreak. And to ensure that the work goes on, it was important that his team takes the appropriate safety precautions.  Prof Wang has for decades been studying bat-borne viruses by scrutinising their genetic code and the virus-bat interaction, among other aspects of biology. The coronavirus causing Covid-19 is believed to have originated from bats.  He said: +If one member of my team gets infected, everyone has to be quarantined, and all the tests we+re doing have to stop for at least two weeks.+  While there are business continuity plans in place, with researchers divided into two teams, it was still important for them to take care of their health because one team in quarantine would mean half the manpower left to do the research, he said.  Prof Wang added: +I beg my team... I mean, they are young people, they+re working day and night, and they ask me if they can go out for a drink. But I tell them, +just drink by yourself+.+  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Prof Wang was one of four panellists involved in the discussion on how personal hygiene and cleanliness were key to tackling the current outbreak.  The other three were Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources; Mr Tai Ji Choong, director of the National Environment Agency+s Department of Public Cleanliness, and Mr Edward D+Silva, chairman of the Public Hygiene Council.  During the discussion, the panellists emphasised how people were the first line of defence against the further spread of the virus, with social grace and personal cleanliness now no longer just a matter of preference or being civic-minded.  Mr Masagos, who also chairs the newly formed SG Clean Taskforce that aims to raise hygiene standards at the national level, stressed that other measures such as border controls and quarantine would not be as effective in combating the outbreak if personal hygiene was neglected.  The virus is spread mainly through respiratory droplets.  Despite stepped-up cleaning and disinfection routines by premise managers, panellists said individuals could also reduce the chances of the virus spreading by picking up after themselves.  This includes disposing of used pieces of tissue paper - or small biohazards, as Mr Masagos calls them - instead of leaving them for others to do so, and returning trays and used cutlery, so that there is less chance of the contaminants coming into contact with others.

The two countries also agreed on applying the same cut-off of 37.5 deg C for the definition of travellers with a fever at the second meeting of the Singapore-Malaysia joint working group on Tuesday (March 24).  The joint working group, which was set up to facilitate greater cross-border cooperation in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, was meeting for the second time, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Wednesday. It conducted its first meeting in Johor Baru last month.  The latest meeting took place via video conference, as Malaysia is in the midst of a partial lockdown that has been extended by two weeks to April 14.  So far, the joint working group has agreed to continue entry screenings by both countries, activate networks for experts to exchange information on the clinical management of patients, as well as share surveillance data to trace travellers+ movements.  The group also agreed on Tuesday to continue health-related discussions relating to the exchange of people, goods and services between both countries during the partial lockdown separately under a special working committee set up recently, said the ministry.  The meeting on Tuesday was co-chaired by Singapore+s Senior Minister of State for Transport and Health Lam Pin Min, who recently also co-chaired a video conference between Asean and the European Union on the coronavirus, and Malaysia+s Deputy Minister for Health Haji Noor Azmi Ghazali.  They tasked the senior officials of the joint working group to coordinate the continued screening at land and sea borders, MOH said.  As of 12pm on Wednesday, Malaysia has recorded 1,756 confirmed cases, while Singapore+s MOH said on Tuesday night that the country has 558 cases.

When approved, this would be about the fastest test out there for Covid-19.  They hope to submit the test for approval in a month+s time. The test looks for the genetic material of the virus in a patient+s secretions collected from a swab.  This sample is then put in a portable device that will give the result in about five to 10 minutes, using an extremely rapid amplification method that they have named Cepat.  +We have done some preliminary clinical validation at the KK Women+s and Children+s Hospital using real patients+ samples, and found the test to be very sensitive and accurate,+ said Prof Ying.  Once it is approved, the technology can be used to make such kits for use in hospitals. It will also be adapted for use in general practitioner clinics, said Prof Ying.  She and her team are among the researchers here and around the world who are racing to come up with point-of-care tests that can tell you if you have Covid-19 much faster than the current standard lab test. The challenge, Prof Ying said, is to develop rapid and accurate diagnostics that can be done without the use of expensive machines.  As the pandemic grows, the spotlight is increasingly falling on testing as a way to contain the spread - for the lack of it has potentially been hiding a large number of cases.  The World Health Organisation has emphasised the need to +test, test, test+, as it allows cases to be picked up earlier and promptly isolated, before they spread it to more people.    Professor Jackie Ying (fourth from left), the head of A*Star+s NanoBio Lab, said she and her team of scientists have been working tirelessly for around six weeks to come up with a rapid test that can tell if a person has Covid-19 in as little as five minutes, after A*Star+s chief executive Frederick Chew (third from left) gave them the challenge of coming up with rapid tests for Covid-19. The test looks for the genetic material of the virus in a patient+s secretions collected from a swab. PHOTO: COURTESY OF JACKIE YING    Some countries are able to do widespread testing; others, like the United States, are experiencing a shortage of tests.  In Singapore, testing started in January at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, where the National Public Health Laboratory is based. By the end of January, all of Singapore+s public hospitals could test for Covid-19, said the group director of medicine at the National University Health System, Professor Dale Fisher. Singapore then tested anyone coming to a hospital with a respiratory illness and anyone who had been in contact with a Covid-19 patient.  Related Story Drugs for other uses being trialled to help patients  +Less than 1 per cent of tests are positive, which reflects the large number being done,+ he said.  These are the standard lab tests that look for the genetic material of the virus in the patient+s secretions, often collected with a nasopharyngeal swab.  The test takes at least two to three hours to show results and requires the use of specialised machines. If samples need to be transported, the turnaround time is even longer.  These tests work by first converting the coronavirus+ RNA to DNA in a method known as reverse transcription (RT). Then, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique is used to amplify the genetic material of the virus so that it can be easily detected.  It is called the RT-PCR test. +It is essentially a molecular photocopier. PCR was invented in 1984, and even in today+s machines, about 60 per cent of the time is spent waiting for the PCR machine to heat up and cool down,+ said Prof Ying.  The latest invention by her and PhD student Muhammad Nadjad Abdul Rahim is a new method to amplify specific DNA\/RNA at a single temperature.  Just like PCR, their method can +photocopy+ the genetic material of the virus millions of times. The difference in their new method is that they can hit a rate of millions of copies within a minute.  One key reason is that unlike PCR, their approach does not require any heating and cooling between each controlled amplification step. This is enabled by a special enzyme developed in Prof Ying+s lab.  Prof Ying said she and her team of scientists have been working tirelessly for around six weeks to come up with the fast test, after A*Star+s chief executive Frederick Chew gave them the challenge of coming up with rapid tests for Covid-19.  Earlier, A*Star had developed PCR test kits for use here and overseas, and has passed the baton to local firm MiRXES, which can mass produce them.  Another local biotech firm Veredus Laboratories developed a three-hour PCR test kit that is being used at checkpoints here.  Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, the programme leader for infectious diseases at the National University of Singapore+s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said that there are many diagnostic tests and kits being developed in China and the US, as well as those by local companies such as MiRXES and Veredus Laboratories, and it is a matter of time before the ones from overseas are available here.  US firm Cepheid has received emergency authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration for its rapid molecular test, which can be used at the point of care for patients and gives a result in 45 minutes. It makes use of machines to run the test, which are already available in Singapore hospitals.  Other types of tests done to find Covid-19 in patients are the sero-logical tests. These look for immunoglobulins, which are the antibodies made by the immune system to fight the virus - in patients+ blood.  These antibodies take a few days to show though, and will not appear in the early stage of the disease. Hence, a blood test will not detect Covid-19 if someone has just been infected with it.  Duke-NUS Medical School was the first in the world to develop a serological test that was put to good use last month to trace two people who were the source of infection of two clusters here.  The two had mild symptoms, were not hospitalised and had recovered, but the test found they had antibodies against the coronavirus.  As serological tests pick up such mild cases, they can be done to ascertain the extent of community spread, as well as asymptomatic spread.  Such tests, however, take several hours to show results. Fast test kits solve the problem but it is very important to note the sensitivity of the tests, said Prof Ying.  There is little point using a very fast test kit when it cannot detect the virus in you most of the time. Or, worse, it may tell you that you are not sick, even though you are infected with Covid-19.  The latter is what is called a false negative, and it can happen, for instance, when the test kit is unable to pick up the virus in a person with a low viral load.  People infected with Covid-19 are believed to shed large quantities of the virus early in their illness (high viral load) and less later on.  Hence, it would be best if a fast test can pick up the infection from a patient at various stages of the disease, regardless of whether he has a high or low viral load, said Prof Ying.  On Saturday, the US Food and Drug Administration said it is already beginning to see unauthorised fraudulent test kits that are being marketed to test for Covid-19 in the home.  Fraudulent health claims, tests and products may keep some patients from seeking care or delay necessary medical treatment, it said. +When you run a test, you must know what you are testing for,+ said Prof Ying.  An RT-PCR test should be able to detect the disease in someone who is in the earlier stage of the disease, when he is shedding more of the virus, and, therefore, likely more infectious.  On the other hand, a serological test can find antibodies in someone who is at the late stage or recovered, when he is shedding less or none of the virus, she said.  +This crisis has forced Singapore to re-examine whether we have the ability to do the various things needed to fight it and we do,+ she said. +We can do the science and we can also develop our own tests.+","48":"SINGAPORE - The National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) has set aside $4 million to help freelancers who are union members cope with the lull in business due to the coronavirus outbreak.  It will enable these members to claim higher training allowances to defray the opportunity cost of going for courses, NTUC said on Wednesday (March 25).  This is in addition to the $36 million Self-Employed Person (SEP) Training Support Scheme announced by Manpower Minister Josephine Teo earlier this month, under which all Singaporean and permanent resident freelancers will receive a training allowance of $7.50 per hour when they undergo eligible courses.  Application for the scheme, which is administered by NTUC+s Employment and Employability Institute (e2i), begins on April 1.  There is no cap on the number of courses which freelancers can attend, and the allowance will be given out after the programmes are completed.  NTUC members who joined the union before March 1, 2020 will receive $8.50 per hour in training allowance, while those who joined after March 1 will get $8 per hour.  Eligible courses for the scheme include all SkillsFuture Series programmes as well as sector-specific courses in areas such as digital skills, security and first aid.  The sector-specific training programmes are curated in partnership between unions and associations, SkillsFuture Singapore, and NTUC+s agencies, so as to widen the selection of courses available to freelancers in line with their areas of work.  NTUC secretary-general Ng Chee Meng encouraged freelancers to use the lull period, caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, to upgrade their skills and broaden their skillsets, as well as to look at other areas of work they may not have considered before.  +We do have vacancies...in the healthcare sector, maybe around 5,000 jobs, and in the security sector, maybe up to 10,000 jobs,+ he told reporters on Wednesday.

Two have died and 155 people have recovered.","50":"SINGAPORE - The number of coronavirus cases will continue to rise in coming weeks, as some of the 200,000 overseas Singaporeans return home, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong on Wednesday (March 25).  He noted that the number of cases in Singapore has more than doubled in the past week, from 266 to a total of 558 currently.  +Almost 80 per cent of these new cases were imported, all from countries other than China even though we continued to see around 1,000 residents and long-term pass holders return from China in the past week,+ he said.  As of Tuesday, there were more than 370,000 Covid-19 cases and over 16,500 fatalities from the disease worldwide, with the epicentre shifting from China to Europe.  In his ministerial statement in Parliament, Mr Gan said Singapore has slowed the spread of Covid-19 through a three-pronged approach: reducing importation, detecting and isolating cases early, and emphasising social responsibility and good personal hygiene habits.  First, Singapore has implemented border controls to stem the inflow of travellers - all short-term visitors, including tourists, have been barred from entering or transiting since Tuesday.  The Government also advised Singaporeans to defer all travel until the global situation is under control.  It has strengthened border checks to detect and isolate cases before they come into contact with the wider community, and taken steps to detect cases early through surveillance at hospitals, polyclinics and the network of Public Health Preparedness Clinics.  Singapore residents have benefited from more than 267,000 subsidised attendances at these clinics so far, on top of those at polyclinics, Mr Gan said.  Related Story 49 new coronavirus cases in Singapore, of which 32 are from overseas  Related Story Singapore residents who continue to travel abroad will pay full hospital charges if warded for coronavirus  He added that Singapore has also carried out around 39,000 tests for Covid-19 to date.  This translates to 6,800 tests per million people in Singapore, compared with around 6,500 in South Korea, and 1,000 in Taiwan.  These tests are key in detecting as many cases as possible and as early as possible, he said.  +How the outbreak develops globally will depend on the strategies and efforts of countries around the world,+ Mr Gan said, noting the World Health Organisation has advised that the course of the pandemic can still be changed if all countries take the necessary containment actions.  +Otherwise, we will continue to see the number of affected countries and cases rise rapidly.+  The top three sources of imported cases to Singapore are the United Kingdom, the United States and Indonesia, Mr Gan said.  The minister gave the assurance that Singapore will have sufficient capacity to meet all healthcare needs, including those of coronavirus patients.  \u201cWe had invested significantly in the past to ensure that we have sufficient healthcare capacity to manage infectious outbreaks,\u201d he added, noting that the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases was purpose-built with spare capacity, and can be further increased to over 500 beds if necessary.  At the beginning of the epidemic, Singapore took the conservative approach of admitting all Covid-19 cases, regardless of severity, until they tested negative twice over 24 hours.  But now, it is clear that about 80 per cent of cases are mild or moderate, with many patients in hospital experiencing mild symptoms similar to the flu.  \u201cThey only require limited medical care, and what we need really are isolation facilities to prevent them from infecting others, until they are free of the virus,\u201d Mr Gan said.  This is why the Government is tapping private hospitals and setting up community care facilities, he said.  Concord International Hospital started accepting well and stable Covid-19 patients last Friday and Mount Elizabeth Hospital saw its first such patient on Monday. The Government has also converted some government quarantine facilities, starting with D\u2019Resort with a maximum capacity of about 500, for this purpose.

Related Story Coronavirus: 49 patients moved to private hospitals to free up capacity at public facilities  Related Story Coronavirus: How contact tracers track down the people at risk of infection  Patients in these facilities will continue to be quarantined and closely monitored, Mr Gan said, so there is no risk of the public in the community being exposed to these cases while they are at these facilities.  \u201cOnly when they have fully recovered and tested negative for the virus twice over a duration of 24 hours, will they be discharged back into the community. At this point, they no longer have any risk of transmitting the virus to others, as they have fully recovered,\u201d he added.  \u201cWe will continue to explore the use of such isolation facilities for our well and stable Covid-19 patients. This way, we can focus our critical hospital resources on the seriously ill, to minimise the number of fatalities.\u201d  Singapore+s strategy, he said, is to slow down the infection rate and keep it as low as possible.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  In preparation for the expected surge in cases in the coming weeks, the Government has expanded its +contact tracing capacity+, from three teams at the start to 20 teams today, he added. These teams include officers from public service agencies and the Singapore Armed Forces.  Singapore can now trace up to 4,000 contacts each day, and will continue to scale up its contact tracing capacity as needed, Mr Gan said.","51":"Sweeping measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak in Singapore were announced on Tuesday (March 24) by the Government\u2019s multi-ministry task force tackling the outbreak.  These include the closure of entertainment outlets and limiting gatherings outside of work and school to 10 people or fewer.  With the 49 new cases reported on Tuesday, the total number of imported cases here is 326.  This is nearly three in five of all 558 confirmed coronavirus cases here.  The risk is expected to heighten in the coming days as more Singaporeans return from abroad.  All returnees from Britain and the United States will have to serve their mandatory 14-day stay-home notice in dedicated hotels to reduce transmission.  Here is a look at the recent measures:    From March 26, 11.59pm  Gatherings outside of work and school limited to 10 persons or fewer. People must keep at least 1m apart in non-transient gatherings (for example, a yoga class).  Bars and entertainment venues, such as nightclubs, discos, cinemas, theatres and karaoke outlets, will be closed until April 30. This might be extended if the situation does not improve.  Malls, museums and attractions, where contact is more transient, may remain open. But they must abide by the following:  Reduce the number of people at any one time and keep to no more than one person per 16 sq m of usable space. This is about the size of a Housing Board flat bathroom. Groups must not exceed 10 persons. Indoor and outdoor shows within attractions will be suspended, as will museum group tours and open atrium sales events. Make sure there is at least 1m of physical space between patrons, including at queues and waiting areas. They should try to offer services by appointment or digitally. Crowds should be quickly cleared. Places that cannot meet these requirements must be closed. If found to be a place of transmission because they did not adhere to these measures, they may face additional penalties.

Events and mass gatherings, including conferences, concerts and sporting events, must be deferred or cancelled, regardless of size.  All social gatherings and events with more than 10 people at a time, such as private birthday parties and weddings, are discouraged.  Funerals and wakes should be limited to family members, with gatherings of 10 people or fewer at a time.  From March 27  Singapore residents and long-term pass holders who disregard travel advisories and leave Singapore will have to pay unsubsidised rates at public hospitals if they are admitted for suspected Covid-19 and develop symptoms within 14 days of their return.  Residents will also not be able to claim from MediShield Life or Integrated Shield Plans for these treatments at public and private hospitals.  Any work pass holder or his dependant who leaves Singapore will be deprioritised for entry approval.  For seniors  Suspension of activities is extended to April 30. Seniors are urged to avoid social gatherings and crowded places, and to go out only for essential purposes like work and to buy food.  Returning Singaporeans, residents and long-term work pass holders  Those coming back from the US and Britain will be transported from the airport to selected hotels to serve their 14-day stay home notice (SHN), with effect from March 25, 11.59pm.

In a joint ministerial statement issued on Wednesday (March 25), the countries - including Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, Myanmar and Brunei - said they will ensure that trade lines via land, air and sea remain open for the flow of goods and essential supplies.  +We recognise that it is in our mutual interest to ensure that trade lines remain open,+ said the joint statement issued by Singapore+s Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI).  +We are committed to working with all like-minded countries to ensure that trade continues to flow unimpeded, and that critical infrastructure such as our air and seaports remain open to support the viability and integrity of supply chains globally,+ it added.  Freight carriers around the world are struggling to deliver goods by land, sea or air as the pandemic has forced governments to impose lockdowns, threatening supplies of vital products including medicines. Stockpiling and panic buying by consumers are also adding to supply strains.  In a Facebook post after the release of the joint statement, Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing said: +Countries must band together and unite in this fight against the virus instead of making decisions that threaten global trade.  +As a country that prides itself on its openness and strong connectivity, Singapore is committed to bringing like-minded partners together to uphold trade and supply chain connectivity, and will continue to lead efforts in this area.+  He also welcomed more countries +to join us in this endeavour+, saying it would greatly boost efforts to maintain open and connected supply chains.  Related Story Countries are starting to hoard food amid coronavirus fears, threatening global trade  While China+s extreme measures to stop the spread of the virus are now allowing its economy slowly to come back online, supply chains are disintegrating in other parts of the world.  An MTI spokesman on Wednesday noted a sharp drop in airfreight capacity in the wake of flight cancellations and reduced connectivity. Airfreight charges have correspondingly become volatile, rising multiple times.  Globally, some seaports have had restrictions imposed, including suspending port operations, said the spokesman. There have also been some disruptions to land transport because of enhanced border controls.  \u201cThe joint announcement seeks to be a timely and reassuring signal internationally and domestically,\u201d said the MTI spokesman.  \u201cSingapore hopes that the statement will also catalyse concrete outcomes among the participating countries, such as refraining from imposing export controls, as well as identifying and addressing trade disruptions, especially in essential goods.\u201d  For instance, the production of medical equipment often involves supply chains that straddle multiple countries. That means countries must ensure that components and raw materials can flow unimpeded and efficiently, and global supplies of essential goods can be continually replenished.  The joint ministerial statement was borne out of a Singapore initiative, aimed at upholding trade connectivity and maintaining supply chains in response to the Covid-19 disruption. It follows the move last week by Singapore and New Zealand to affirm their commitment to ensure supply chains remain open and connected.  +The decisions that are made today will have a lasting effect on the global economy when the situation stabilises,+ said Mr Chan in his post. +While the short-term challenges are real and severe, as responsible governments, we must continue to keep an eye on the future and what it will bring for our businesses and people after the virus has been defeated.+  LISTEN TO MONEY HACKS PODCAST","53":"Tuition centres are ready to go online, even as parents questioned the need for them to close.

This is to ensure that the engagement and interaction between students and tutors remains, he said.  Some parents welcomed the new measures.  Ms Angeline Goh said she had pulled her Primary 1 son out of his aikido class last month. He also attends creative writing enrichment lessons.  +The percentage of risk reduces with the suspension of such classes+, added the 41-year-old, who works in customer service.","54":"SINGAPORE - New measures to help businesses cope with the coronavirus outbreak have been rolled out by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).  In a statement on Tuesday (March 24) MOM said that, with immediate effect, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will get a three-month extension for paying the levy for the foreign workers they hire. This is expected to give these companies more flexibility with managing their cash flows.  Another measure announced is an up to 90-day waiver on levies for foreign workers on overseas leave. This also takes effect immediately.  The last measure is a refund on the +man year entitlement+ for foreign workers in construction firms.  Under the man-year entitlement framework, these firms can pay lower levies for a certain number of foreign workers, depending on the project. The lower levies are paid monthly for a year.  With the refund scheme, the lower levy for a foreign worker is not forfeited if the worker leaves, or is unable to work. Instead, the unused lower levy benefit can be used for another worker.  Companies can apply to the Building and Construction Authority for the refund scheme from April 1 for a period of six months.  MOM also urged firms with extra manpower to give priority to locals in keeping their jobs. These firms should also allow their foreign workers to be transferred to other firms facing a manpower shortage.  On the extension of the SME foreign worker levy payment, about 60,000 firms can benefit from this relief measure and it will apply to levies incurred in 2020.  SMEs will have up to five months to pay for the foreign worker levy from the month it is incurred. Currently, the foreign worker levy incurred is due by the 14th of the following month.  Employers who do not make the payment on time will have their new and renewal work pass applications rejected. If they cannot make payment on time for two consecutive months, all existing work passes under that employer will be revoked.  MOM urged companies that benefit from the extension to keep their existing workers and not employ new foreign workers. The ministry will not allow new applications of work passes from these firms, although it will accept renewals.  The late payment penalty of 2 per cent a month will still apply to levy payments which are extended.  For the 90-day levy waiver for foreign workers on overseas leave, this was extended due to tighter border restrictions and difficulties workers may face when returning to Singapore.  It applies to firms that send their foreign workers home from now until the end of this year.  The current levy waiver for up to 60 days applies to foreign workers who go on overseas home leave for at least seven consecutive days.  The refund scheme for construction companies that allows them to reallocate lower levies comes after feedback from the Singapore Contractors Association Limited that construction firms are facing disruptions due to delays in overseas supplies and travel restrictions on foreign construction workers.  As a result of these disruptions, construction firms are unable to fully utilise the year-long lower levies under the man-year entitlement framework.  This means higher costs to contractors who will have to hire foreign workers on higher levy rates.  But with the new refund scheme, companies can use the remaining unused lower levy benefits for new workers or existing ones.  Following the Ministry of Health+s advisory against all travel abroad on March 18, MOM said it would be limiting the number of entry approvals for work pass holders to enter Singapore.  MOM said that a very small number of these work pass holders would be allowed to enter, with priority given to essential services like healthcare and transport.  With this, the ministry advised employers to defer plans to bring in new foreign workers from overseas until the coronavirus situation stabilises. If foreign workers are still needed, they should use foreign workers already in Singapore.  If the foreign workers are not needed, employers should allow them to be transferred to other employers who face a manpower shortage in the same sector.  Firms in manufacturing and services can approach the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) for assistance under the SBF ManpowerConnect scheme while construction firms can use the online Foreign Construction Worker Directory System to match workers with prospective employers.  More information on all the measures is available on the MOM website.","55":"The number of coronavirus patients aged between 20 and 29 has overtaken that of patients aged 60 and above to become the largest infected group, with most young adults having caught the bug overseas, primarily in Britain.  Of the 558 Covid-19 patients, 141 are between 20 and 29 years old, compared with 111 patients who are 60 and above. Out of these 141 cases of young adults, 78 per cent, or 111 cases, were imported.  Around three in five, or 68 of the 111 imported cases of young adults, had a travel history to the United Kingdom, The Straits Times (ST) has found, based on government figures and profiles of the patients.  Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of National University of Singapore+s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, told ST: +The number of young people being infected reflects the demographics of people returning to Singapore as a result of the global situation, where a number of countries in Europe and North America are seeing widespread community transmission.  +A large segment of the people coming into Singapore in the past week are locals who have been overseas for studies, work placements or internships. They are predominantly people in their 20s and 30s.+  Though past reports have suggested the elderly are more likely to be infected, young people are not immune to the virus, said Prof Teo.  He said: +I must emphasise that Covid-19 is not a disease of the elderly. Children, as well as healthy adults, are also susceptible to it.+  While the elderly and those with pre-existing health issues are more likely to progress to more severe infections and experience higher mortality rates, he said, +in terms of infection, both groups are equally at risk+.  Visiting professor Annelies Wilder-Smith of Nanyang Technological University+s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, said: +Older people, even if they spend less time in the community, will be infected by the younger people who interact with the older people at home.  +For this reason, some countries are trying different strategies to protect this most vulnerable group.+  On the perception that younger adults might be less risk averse, Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, infectious diseases programme leader at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: +It is likely that a small fraction of young people here will defy stay-home notices... and continue to go out. This is possibly because they do not appreciate the risk or feel that they are not at risk, or else are unable to tolerate +cabin fever+ being cooped up in their rooms for two weeks.  +This is why the penalties are set relatively high as a deterrence.+  Related Story Coronavirus: New evidence shows young people are falling seriously ill  Those who breach the stay-home notice will face fines of up to $10,000 or jail of up to six months, or both, the Ministry of Health said yesterday.  National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said on Tuesday: +We have always been doing enforcement through the use of remote monitoring, and spot checks, but we are putting in place enhanced enforcement.  +Whoever flouts stay-home requirements and are caught - we will not hesitate to prosecute, and to apply these penalties.+  Around 20 per cent of cases here involve patients aged 60 and above.  Prof Teo said: +It is a reflection of the way the disease is spreading in Singapore - we have had a few large clusters like the Safra Jurong cluster which involved people in that age group.+  Those younger than 20 make up just a small fraction - 17 out of 558 confirmed cases.  Infectious disease expert Leong Hoe Nam said: +It begs the question of the manner in which the disease was acquired - if it was at work or in the community and less so in schools. There is also a possibility of many asymptomatic individuals.+  He added: +More research into this will be required.+  Correction note: This story has been corrected to say that those who breach the stay-home notice will face fines of up to $10,000 or jail of up to six months, or both.","56":"SINGAPORE - Patients who are well but still testing positive for the coronavirus will be moved to a new Community Isolation Facility to ensure that healthcare facilities can cope with a possible surge in a number of cases.  The Health Ministry (MOH) announced on Tuesday (March 24) that it had set up an isolation facility which can accommodate 500 people at D+Resort NTUC in Pasir Ris.  Said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong: +As the number of Covid-19 cases rises across the world, we expect the number of cases in Singapore to increase. Therefore, we are taking steps to increase our healthcare capacity.  +Over last few days, we have been sending patients to some private hospitals. Today, we have operationalised a community isolation facility.+  Currently, patients who are well enough to be discharged from medical care but still test positive for the Covid-19 virus have been isolated in hospitals. MOH said that this was not an efficient use of hospital resources as the patients do not require significant medical care.  The community isolation facility is modelled after the existing government quarantine facilities, and will be managed with a higher baseline level of infection control by staff, MOH added. The cost of isolation in the community isolation facility will be borne by the Government.","57":"SINGAPORE - Pre-school and primary school pupils living in the same household as a person who has returned to Singapore from any country from Wednesday 11.59pm (March 25) will be placed on 14-day leave of absence (LOA).  The Ministry of Education and Ministry of Social and Family Development announced this additional precautionary measures for pupils on Tuesday following the recent spike in imported cases in Singapore.  Pupils living in the same household as a person who had returned to Singapore from Britain, the United States or Asean countries on or after March 14 will also be placed on LOA.  The pupil+s LOA will start from the day the person in the household returned here.  The ministries said these measures will be implemented to protect younger school-going children.  As of Tuesday, about three in five of the 558 coronavirus patients here are imported. A week ago, this was lower at nearly two in five of all patients.  The new measures are on top of the 14-day LOA issued to students and staff of schools, pre-schools and student care centres if they returned from overseas on or after March 14.  To accommodate these exceptional circumstances, MOE and MSF encouraged employers to provide flexible work arrangements for their employees.  The ministries said they will monitor the situation closely and work with schools, pre-schools, student care centres, parents and the community to \u201censure that our schools, pre-schools and student care centres remain safe\u201d.  They also urged all other students and staff who are living with people on LOAs or stay-home notices to monitor their health, see a doctor if they are sick and return to school only when they have fully recovered.","58":"SINGAPORE - The closure of all 70 mosques here, initially planned for just two weeks, will be extended indefinitely in order to prevent any further spread of the coronavirus, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) announced on Tuesday (March 24).  Singapore+s highest Islamic authority, Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir, said at a press conference that when mosque closures were first announced on March 12, Muis had said that mosques would only be reopened when it was responsible and safe to do so.  +At that time, there were less than 200 cases in Singapore. But the number now stands, as of yesterday, at 509 cases with two deaths,+ said Dr Nazirudin. +The situation clearly has not improved, but has instead worsened.+  As the risk to the community remains high, the Fatwa Committee has recommended the continued closure of mosques until further notice, Muis added.  Dr Nazirudin heads the committee, which issues religious rulings for Muslims here, and was guided in its decision by the principle of avoiding harm, as well as closing all doors that lead to danger.  The closures mean that no congregational prayers, including Friday prayers, can be performed at mosques. The council said that under Muslim law, the possibility of becoming ill and fear for one+s safety are valid reasons not to hold or attend such prayers.  Many Muslims believe Friday prayers should not be missed for three weeks in a row, and Muis said this is not an issue as they are not obligatory, given the situation.  +In particular, the Fatwa Committee also noted that under these circumstances, with the risk of infection still on the rise, it is the responsibility of every Muslim to help keep everyone safe,+ added Muis.  Muis had initially announced on March 12 the closure of all mosques for five days for cleaning after several congregants tested positive for the coronavirus after attending a mass religious gathering in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  Related Story Coronavirus and religious worship in Singapore: Muslims turn to online sermons after mosque closures  On March 16, Muis announced that this would be extended by another nine days to complete one incubation period of the coronavirus.  But even as mosques here are closed indefinitely, a move first announced on Sunday to open small spaces for prayer in the afternoons to cater to congregants who need them remains.  Nineteen mosques across Singapore will be opened to provide a space for no more than 20 people at a time to perform their two afternoon prayers individually. These spaces will be open only between 1.15pm and 6pm.  Muis said the move comes after it had received feedback from congregants like taxi drivers and delivery riders that they face problems finding a place to pray during the day.  On Tuesday, Muis said that while mosques here remain closed, they will continue to provide essential services to the community via alternate means.  Religious lectures and talks will be carried out through online platforms and weekly religious classes will be replaced by e-learning.  Low-income households who are keen to apply for long-term zakat financial assistance can still do so at mosques too.  Muis also released the results of an online survey it conducted last Thursday and Friday to gauge the community+s response to the closure of mosques, as well as its preparedness for additional precautionary measures when mosques eventually reopen.  Out of the 32,000 respondents, almost 80 per cent said that they were ready to bring their own personal prayer items, that they were comfortable to have their temperature taken and that they were agreeable to contact tracing being done.  Almost half of the respondents also said that vulnerable groups like the elderly should avoid visiting mosques during the Covid-19 situation.  Related Story Coronavirus and religious worship in Singapore: Return of the house church  Mosques are not the only religious institutions to stop their activities - the Catholic Church has said earlier this month that it would be suspending masses indefinitely in order to minimise the risk of coronavirus spread.  Last Thursday, the Anglican Diocese of Singapore said that all regular worship services and gatherings in Anglican parish churches islandwide have been suspended until April 3.  The Panguni Uthiram chariot and foot procession slated for April 6, which is part of the annual Panguni Uthiram festival that is celebrated by Hindus, has also been cancelled due to concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.","59":"SINGAPORE - Test samples from possible Covid-19 patients can now have a lower risk of contamination during delivery to laboratories, which would allow for more accurate testing in countries where samples have to be transported over long distances.  The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) and Lucence, a genomics company led by oncologist Tan Min-Han, have jointly developed a new kit that allows for samples to be transported at room temperature, instead of in a refrigerated environment.  The Safer-Sample kit contains a bottle of fluid that can be mixed with certain types of virus samples at the point of collection.  This fluid can keep the samples stable at room temperature for up to a week, said A*Star and Lucence.  The World Health Organisation had said that the virus specimens should be stored and shipped at 4 deg C if they reach the laboratory in less than 72 hours, and at -20 deg C, or ideally -80 deg C, on dry ice or liquid nitrogen if they reach the laboratory in more than 72 hours.  But A*Star and Lucence said the equipment to transport samples in such conditions are in short supply worldwide.  +Among other factors, accurate diagnostic testing depends on sampling quality, storage and transport to the testing laboratory,+ said the organisations.  +However, chilled transport media is not universally available and subject to worldwide shortages, leading to the risk of compromised testing because of specimen drying, contamination or degradation, especially if transported at room temperature.+  They said this kit will be especially useful in countries where samples must be transported across long distances for testing.  Concerns about these samples not being properly refrigerated while being sent to labs have previously been raised in Indonesia.  Samples can be collected through methods such as throat swabs, nose swabs or phlegm, depending on the countries.  Related Story Demand for coronavirus test kits lifts fortune of South Korean firm+s founder  Lucence is a genomic medicine firm that is headquartered in Singapore and California, and traditionally focuses on cancer testing.  Dr Tan, its chief executive officer, is the elder brother of Mr Tan Min-Liang, the co-founder of gaming hardware firm Razer.  Dr Tan said Lucence+s technology can also contribute accurate testing solutions amid the current Covid-19 pandemic.  The firm will donate up to 10,000 of the Safer-Sample kits to the scientific community.  He added that the kit is also being evaluated to see if it can +inactivate+ the coronavirus.  Inactivation of a virus results in the virus becoming unable to infect someone, while still allowing for its presence to be detected.  He said: +Should Safer-Sample be able to inactivate virus at the point of sample collection, the sample would be less hazardous during transport and lab processing, thereby reducing risks to those involved.+  The National Centre for Infectious Diseases is currently evaluating non-invasive patient specimens, such as saliva, collected with the Safer-Sample reagent.  Related Story Coronavirus cases without symptoms spur call for wider tests  Meanwhile, Lucence is working with the Ministry of Health for further testing and evaluation of the kits.  Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, the infectious diseases programme leader at the National University of Singapore+s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said the kit was timely given that primary care and community testing of Covid-19 are becoming urgent needs.  Prof Hsu, who is also adjunct clinician-scientist at A*Star+s Institute of Bioengineering Nanotechnology, added: +Public-private partnerships that result in these breakthroughs are critical for delivering necessary resources in areas that either are unable to achieve alone.+","60":"SINGAPORE - The Republic has confirmed 49 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday (March 24) as students and workers continued to return home in droves from abroad.  A total of 32 of the 49 cases were imported by travellers who returned to Singapore. Of the 32, 25 are Singaporean citizens or residents, while five are long-term visitor pass holders, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).  Eight had travelled to Britain and six had arrived from the United States. The remaining travellers went to other countries including Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, Germany, the Philippines and Australia.  Of the 17 local cases announced, four cases are linked to previous cases while 13 are currently not linked to travel or previous cases. Contact tracing is being conducted.  With the new cases on Tuesday, the total number of imported cases is 326, nearly three in five of all 558 confirmed coronavirus cases in Singapore now.  Of the coronavirus patients here, 17 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. A total of 155 have recovered and two have died.  To date, the Ministry of Health has identified 8,822 close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 2,803 are now quarantined, and 6,019 have completed it.  The number of new cases on Tuesday is a dip from the 54 cases on Monday, which set a new record for the number of cases announced in a day.  MOH also announced on Tuesday that all entertainment outlets will be closed, and gatherings outside work and school will be limited to 10 people or fewer, with people having to keep at least 1m apart when they interact for prolonged periods of time.  All centre-based tuition and enrichment classes will be suspended too.

But family members are still worried, there is always a risk that infection can happen to someone in close proximity.+  Those who have already returned from the US and UK and are currently serving their stay-home notice in their homes may also apply to stay in these dedicated facilities.  The move was one of a range of new measures announced on Tuesday amid a wave of imported cases.  The Ministry of Health noted that those coming in from the UK and US account for the largest share of imported cases by far. About 1,200 people a day have been returning from these two countries.

Odette\u2019s chef-owner Julien Royer, 37, and his team watched the online ceremony together at the restaurant, he told The Straits Times, which helped them to temporarily forget their worries over the past few weeks.  He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a challenging time for us all in the food and beverage industry. It\u2019s difficult to celebrate at the moment, but we take this as a sign of positivity and optimism for us. We have to find solutions and hope for a better future.\u201d  The restaurant has been hit by a spate of cancellations in the last few days, said chef Royer, as about 30 per cent of their diners are tourists who have cancelled their trips to Singapore. He also expressed concern over their supply of ingredients as they rely heavily on imported produce.  Overall, it was a strong showing from restaurants in Singapore.  Restaurant Zen - by Swedish chef Bjorn Frantzen, who runs the three-Michelin-starred Frantzen restaurant in Stockholm - debuted on the list at No. 28. The restaurant in Bukit Pasoh Road - which has been hot on the foodie radar - was also awarded two Michelin stars in its debut on last year+s Michelin Guide.

They are the Singapore American School (SAS) and the United World College of South East Asia (UWCSEA), with each having three parents diagnosed with the virus.  SAS\u2019 superintendent Tom Boasberg said all its three parents are hospitalised and are in good condition. None of them had visited the school.  \u201cIn all cases, the parents and their family members have fully followed Ministry of Health restrictions, including staying home immediately upon learning of the family member\u2019s confirmed case,\u201d said Mr Boasberg.  At the UWCSEA, which has two campuses in Dover and Tampines, three parents of its students are confirmed cases. None of its students and staff have the virus.  \u201cNone of these parents came to campus or attended a school event in the weeks before they were diagnosed with Covid-19,\u201d a spokesman said.  Messages have been recently circulating online about a recent gathering attended by SAS students, that has links to one of the parents who is a confirmed case.  In response to queries from The Straits Times, Mr Boasberg said the parent in question was found to have the virus on March 15 and he had been labelled an imported case.  Travelling alone, the man contracted the virus while in a European country, which was at that time not one of the countries that Singapore had advised against travel to.  He returned to Singapore on March 13 and sought medical advice the next day for the mild fever he was experiencing. The doctor sent him back home to rest.  Mr Boasberg said a swab test done on March 14 confirmed that the parent has the coronavirus and he was admitted to a hospital the next day.

But Mr Boasberg said the father was neither at the event nor at school, and had no contact with students other than his child after returning from overseas.  +As soon as the father was diagnosed, this student stayed home and had no contact with other students,\u201d Mr Boasberg added.  The school, which is situated in Woodlands and has a 4,000 student body, is currently on a spring break that began last Saturday and will last until Sunday (March 29).  Mr Boasberg said the school is taking advantage of the break to conduct deep cleaning of its campus, having already stepped up cleaning efforts in the past two months.  The school had initiated home-based learning last Thursday and Friday, before the spring break started, with students staying at home while teachers went to school to give virtual lessons.  It will continue conducting distance learning for another week after spring break, while monitoring the situation in Singapore. Unless circumstances change, classes will resume at the school\u2019s campus on April 6.  Said Mr Boasberg: \u201cOur overriding priority in our decisions is the health and safety of our community. We have seen that the vast majority of the recent uptick in cases in Singapore is from overseas returnees.  \u201cWe are aware that local schools in Singapore resumed classes on Monday, March 23.

Other international schools have also switched to remote learning, or brought forward their spring breaks, in a bid to keep students at home.  The UWCSEA\u2019s term break, which was scheduled to start on Friday, began last Wednesday instead. Lessons will resume on April 6.  Said the spokesman: \u201cThe decision as to whether this is in the classrooms on campus, or via remote learning will be made closer to the date and communicated to our community directly.  \u201cWe are fully prepared for either eventuality and are currently working to support students and families impacted by announcements made by external examining bodies.\u201d  In the light of the coronavirus outbreak, the International Baccalaureate has scrapped its examinations in May, affecting students in schools here like Tanglin Trust School and Dulwich College Singapore.  Exam board Cambridge Assessment International Education also cancelled its International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) exams in May and June because of worldwide school closures.  Tanglin Trust School, which has 2,800 students, has no confirmed cases among students or staff. The school started conducting e-learning last Thursday (March 19), and will continue until Friday, March 27. It will then close for a two-week holiday and classes will resume on April 13.  Mr Tom Evans, the school\u2019s director of marketing and communications, cited concerns about the recent travel histories of people connected with the school returning from abroad and said the school experienced operational difficulties caused by increasing travel restrictions.  A large number of people within the extended Tanglin community returned to Singapore from abroad in mid-March, including family members returning from work trips and students returning from universities and schools in Britain, said Mr Evans.  \u201cThe inability to be certain of people\u2019s travel histories within households was a significant factor in our deliberations,\u201d he said, adding that staff were concerned about their own health and there was a spike in student absenteeism.  It was becoming extremely difficult for senior leaders to carry out their duties in the daily administration of the school, and the closure of the border with Malaysia impacted many of our operations team members, he said.

Other international schools are continuing lessons as per normal, while stepping up precautionary measures.  Mr Christian Soulard, principal of International French School (Singapore), said it has \u201cno plans to close at this time\u201d, but has put in place extra hygiene procedures like twice-daily temperature-taking, and extra cleaning and disinfecting on school premises.  \u201cStudents are regularly reminded to practise good personal hygiene habits and social distancing. All extra-curricular activities have been postponed and large events and overseas trips, as well as day trips and excursions, have been cancelled,\u201d he said.  To be prepared, the school is conducting a trial for its home-based learning on Tuesday and Wednesday for students and teachers.  \u201cThis test will allow us to test various IT infrastructure, learning and communication tools while provide students and teachers with useful practice and experience,\u201d said Mr Soulard.  Fashion and lifestyle curator Samia Khan, 43, whose two boys attend SAS, said: \u201cIt\u2019s very unfortunate that the imported cases came from parents who had travelled, so it\u2019s timely to limit the exposure of students during these two weeks.\u201d  Image consultant Sujata Kumar, 41, whose twin girls go to UWCSEA in Dover, said the school has been proactive and transparent in sharing information about the situation.  +The spike in imported cases is a wake-up call, and in an international school environment, you\u2019d never know where families have travelled and if they are taking necessary precautions.\u201d  Additional reporting by Jolene Ang","65":"SINGAPORE - Senior citizens and other vulnerable groups will get their own dedicated shopping hours at FairPrice stores, Cold Storage and Giant outlets, as the supermarkets take steps to provide safe shopping environments for these groups during the coronavirus outbreak.  On Monday morning (March 24), NTUC FairPrice said in a statement that those of the Pioneer Generation, pregnant women and people with disabilities will have their own shopping hour at its supermarkets from next Monday.  This will take place during the first hour of each FairPrice store\u2019s normal operating hours on Monday, and will be from 7am to 8am for stores that operate 24 hours.  Hours later, following queries from The Straits Times, Dairy Farm Group, which operates Cold Storage, Giant, Market Place and Jasons Deli, said it will roll out a similar measure.  Beginning this week, the first hour of opening on Tuesdays and Wednesdays will be set aside for \u201cthe elderly and other vulnerable groups\u201d, it said. For 24-hour stores under Dairy Farm Group, the dedicated shopping hour is from 8am to 9am.  Both retailers\u2019 moves follow the Ministry of Health\u2019s recommendations for safe distancing and greater protection of more vulnerable groups.  Dairy Farm Group said it was also prompted by the recent spike in demand in supermarkets, which may have caused more anxiety among the vulnerable groups over shortage of essential goods. It has designated special checkout lines for these groups of customers during normal operating hours.  Dedicated shopping hours are expected to provide more vulnerable groups with more time and space to do their shopping, while avoiding crowds that could make the 1 metre social distancing rule more difficult to adhere to.  To shop during the priority shopping hour at FairPrice stores, FairPrice said that members of the Pioneer Generation \u2013 which refers to those who were aged 16 during Singapore\u2019s year of independence and are 71 or above this year \u2013 should present their Pioneer Generation card.  They will continue to enjoy the additional discounts from the existing Pioneer Generation Discount scheme that applies when they shop on Mondays and Wednesdays. Both supermarkets also said that they have put in place social distancing measures at their checkout lines.  Related Story FairPrice places purchase limits on essential items to prevent stockpiling due to Malaysia+s lockdown  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Floor markings 1m apart have been placed at checkout queues in all outlets.  FairPrice has also put up in-store posters and made announcements to remind shoppers to keep a safe distance.  At FairPrice outlets, which number more than 200 across the island, all food sampling has also ceased until further notice.  FairPrice added that it has also stepped up cleaning, especially for surfaces shoppers frequently touch such as railings, trolleys, baskets and checkout counters, and have provided hand sanitisers for customers to use.  Dairy Farm Group\u2019s chief executive officer of South-east Asia Food Chris Bush said what the world currently faces is \u201cunprecedented\u201d.  \u201cWe kindly request the support of all our customers by respecting these measures, as we are all dependent on the kindness, understanding and compassion of each other to help us through these challenging times,\u201d he said.","66":"SINGAPORE - The National University of Singapore (NUS) has implemented new penalties, including expulsion, to ensure students comply with temperature-taking measures, in the light of the coronavirus pandemic.  The punishments increase in severity based on the number of offences, with third-time offenders facing immediate suspension of up to a month and the termination of any hostel housing agreement.  In addition, third-time offenders will go before the university+s Board of Discipline for a hearing that could end with them receiving more punishments, such as further suspension or even expulsion.  In a circular to students on Monday evening (March 23), seen by The Straits Times, NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, said: +Temperature monitoring is important because as many as 98 per cent of Covid-19 patients have a fever.+  The university requires all students to take their temperature twice daily - in the morning and afternoon, including weekends and public holidays - and to declare the readings in an online system.  They have to take a photograph of each reading with a date and time stamp, and retain the image for a week. The university will conduct spot checks.  Prof Ho said in the circular: +For the safety of our community, you must comply with the measures we have instituted. Any non-compliance will be dealt with in accordance with the NUS student disciplinary procedures.+  Non-compliance includes making a false declaration, not being able to provide photographic evidence of a temperature reading, or the proportion of temperatures declared is below 70 per cent for one week, or not even one temperature reading each day.  First time offenders will receive a warning letter, with those staying in hostels getting nine demerit points.  The Demerit Point Structure on the university+s website says if a hostelite accumulates 16 demerit points or more within one residential year, which runs from June 1 to May 31 every year, he or she will face a housing suspension of 12 months with effect from the date of the disciplinary outcome letter.  Any demerit points accumulated within a residential year, that amounts to less that 16 points, are reset to zero on June 1.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Second-time offenders will not be able to view their examination results for the second semester of the current academic year, for a month from the date the results are released.  This means they will get their results later than their peers.  Graduating students will not receive their degree scrolls for a month from the date they are issued, and research students will not get to submit their dissertations or theses for examination for a month from the date of the offence.  They will also have to do community service for up to 100 hours, with those staying in hostels receiving an additional nine demerit points, on top of the initial nine for the first offence.  +These measures have been put in place for the benefit of the NUS community. It is essential that you do your part as a student to keep the NUS community safe and healthy,+ said Prof Ho.","67":"SINGAPORE - What does clearing your tray have to do with fighting the coronavirus? And has the Covid-19 outbreak helped in fighting climate change?  The Straits Times sat down with four experts - Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli, Public Hygiene Council chairman Edward D+Silva, the director of the National Environment Agency+s (NEA) department of public cleanliness, Mr Tai Ji Choong, and director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Wang Linfa - to find out more.  Q: What does tray return have to do with my health?  Professor Wang: Infectious materials are living organisms that thrive on food. The longer you leave contaminants on the table, the higher the chances of someone coming in contact with them.  Q: What is one of the worst hygiene habits people here have?  Mr Masagos: Until recently, even myself, after I eat in a hawker centre, I will put my tissue paper inside (my bowl) and I think that+s not littering, it+s just keeping it away from the floor and so forth. But I+m beginning to recognise that these are also what I call little biohazards that you leave on the table sometimes, or even in your bowl.  Eat on a tray so that if the food falls out of your bowl, it falls on the tray, and then when you return the tray, the table is clean for the next person. At the same time, the cleaners do not have to clean up after you.  Q: Is +I cannot find a bin+ a valid excuse for littering?  Mr Tai: Well, just counting the public bins that are owned by NEA, we already have over 11,000 bins - and this doesn+t include the town council bins.  The shopping malls have their own bins. The MRT stations have their own bins. So actually Singapore has no shortage of bins. And the bins are actually within very easy reach.  So there are really no reasons for a person to say +I cannot find a bin, so I just drop (my litter).+  Related Story Keeping clean the first line of defence against coronavirus: Expert panel  Q: What changes are being made to Singapore+s hawker centres to encourage cleaner practices?  Mr D+Silva: We realise that when customers finish their food, if you want them to clear their trays, the tray return facility should be as close as possible to them so that they don+t have to walk a long way. These are just behavioural patterns. So I think this is something which we can learn and we can improve.  The cleaning operators will have to also upskill themselves, and we need to see how we can help them mechanise to some extent, and at the same time educate and promote awareness among their own cleaners... (Cleaners) can do a much better, efficient job if they are doing things other than just clearing your trays. So I think these are little things that we can tweak in the months ahead.  Q: How do cleaning agents and disinfectants help fight the virus?  Prof Wang: The virus has a lipid membrane outside, and for the virus to remain intact, it needs to maintain the lipid.  Many of the cleaning agents can dissolve this lipid, so that+s why it+s very important that we wash our hands either with soap or a sanitiser or 70 per cent ethanol. All of these will not only clean the environment in the general sort of sense but, more specifically for Covid-19, you can actually disrupt the virus and then prevent its transmission.  Q: Can Covid-19 help lower global emissions and fight climate change?  Mr Masagos: Even if there is a positive impact on climate change, the cost to lives is huge, and I don+t think we should be celebrating this.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Related Story Five lessons from fighting Covid-19  Related Story Drill into what makes people socially responsible  We have set the world on this journey of reducing emissions and then getting ready to adapt.

At the same time, we look to new opportunities and new solutions. Fossil fuel versus, say, hydrogen.  All these are very great ideas that we should not dismiss and stop talking about.","68":"SINGAPORE - In the ongoing battle to contain the spread of Covid-19, every measure will help to prevent its spread, from border controls to social distancing recommendations and even personal hygiene habits, experts said on Monday (March 23).  +Social distancing, personal hygiene, (and) business continuity plans can all help to reduce R0 (R-naught) to less than one,+ said infectious diseases expert Wang Linfa, during a panel discussion hosted by The Straits Times on the importance of personal hygiene amid the Covid-19 outbreak.  R0 refers to the basic reproduction number. It indicates the natural spread of the virus, said Professor Wang, who is director of the programme in emerging infectious diseases at Duke-NUS Medical School.  If R0 is less than one, it means each existing infection causes fewer than one new infection. In this case, the disease will decline and eventually die out, but if it is greater than one, it will probably keep spreading.  Countries, including Singapore, are taking measures to drive R0 to less than one, said Prof Want.  +I think so far we+re doing pretty good, but I think we need to really keep it up,+ he said, adding that everyone, from the individual to the Government, could help to draw down R0 for Covid-19.  Prof Wang said the R0 for Covid-19 is estimated to be between two and three, similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). In comparison, the R0 for measles is about 12.  Prof Wang said bringing R0 down would also help to +flatten the epidemic curve+ by preventing the number of infected cases from surging suddenly.  The epidemic curve is an n-shaped curve that is used to visualise when new cases happen and at what speed during a virus outbreak.  Said Prof Wang: +If you let the natural R0 play out, the hospitals will collapse because there+s not enough beds, not enough ventilators. So the strategy is to flatten the curve so that, for example, you have severe cases of 10 per day rather than a hundred or a thousand per day.+  Prof Wang was one of four panellists who took part in Monday+s discussion.  The other three included Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli, who is head of the new SG Clean task force; Mr Edward D+Silva, chairman of the Public Hygiene Council; and Mr Tai Ji Choong, director of the National Environment Agency+s Department of Public Cleanliness.  While other measures - such as adhering to social distancing recommendations and staying home if one feels ill - are important, Mr Masagos said that it was also important for people to practise good cleanliness habits.  Related Story Keeping clean the first line of defence against coronavirus: Expert panel  +Public hygiene, personal hygiene is our first defence. And it+s not just our defence against Covid-19 today, but against other breakouts that we cannot foresee in future,+ he said.  Asked if travelling on public transport was safe, given the recent recommendations for people to keep their distance from others, Mr Masagos said the risk of exposure depended on a number of factors, including duration and intensity of exposure, and the density of the crowd.  Huge crowds, such as the religious gathering at a mosque in Malaysia, was one example of high-density situations that should be avoided, said Mr Masagos, who is also Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs.  +The other is intensity - how close are you to the person, how much you+re interacting with the person,+ he said, citing the cluster of Covid-19 patients who were linked to a dinner event at Safra Jurong.  Contact-tracing efforts had found that the patients linked to the event had also spent time together outside the dinner, including going for karaoke sessions together.  Duration of exposure is also important, said Mr Masagos, adding that the rough guideline is to keep exposure to under about 30 minutes.  Said Mr Masagos: +Therefore, if in any social setting, if you can ensure that you have short duration, you have low intensity and you have low density, then you are safer than not.+  Prof Wang added that in such an outbreak, there is no fail-safe measure and that there is a risk of exposure in any closed environment, including in an elevator.  However, he said: +But if you have to take public transport, the chance in Singapore of getting on a contaminated MRT, for example, is very low.+  Said Prof Wang: +But even if the hand is contaminated, you+re not going to be infected. It+s only when you rub your nose or your eyes. You just need to be cautious that when you go out in public... Then as soon as you get to the office or home, wash your hands. I think that+s the best you can do.+","69":"SINGAPORE - Residents might see their trash around for longer periods than usual, with waste collection timings being extended from 7pm now to 10pm in the days to come.  The cleaning frequency might also be reduced and certain areas might only be cleaned on alternate days, said Mr Tai Ji Choong, director of the Department of Public Cleanliness at the National Environment Agency (NEA), at a Straits Times panel discussion on Monday (March 23) on tackling the spread of Covid-19 here.  The changes in operations come as cleaning service providers here face a lack of manpower following the lockdown imposed by Malaysia earlier this month, which affected a number of cleaners in Singapore who come from across the Causeway.  Mr Tai said that the maintenance of cleanliness in critical areas such as drains - which are a source of dengue mosquito breeding - as well as the emptying of bins, will be prioritised. The same goes for areas that have very high footfall, he added.  He said: +But for all other areas, we may have to reduce our cleaning frequencies, and we ask for residents+ understanding that for certain areas that are cleaned daily, we may have to actually clean (on) alternate days.  +We ask also for residents+ understanding that the refuse may be with them for a longer time... Our workers will try their best to remove it as quickly as possible.+  Mr Tai added that Singapore+s incineration plants remain unaffected but the agency will continue to monitor other waste management services such as waste recycling.  +Our message to Singaporeans is this: Please don+t litter. Throw your litter into the bins. If everybody acted responsibly, we can still keep Singapore clean, even with the reduced manpower required to clean Singapore.+  The agency is also looking to have more areas cleaned by mechanical road sweepers, he added.  Related Story Keeping clean the first line of defence against coronavirus: Expert panel  Mr Tai also said in the panel discussion that NEA, together with the Health Ministry and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, has developed a set of interim guidelines for disinfection which owners of premises have to follow closely.  Whenever a new case of infection has been reported, the agency walks the premises+ cleaning crew through the cleaning process - including wearing proper personal protective equipment, using the right disinfectants and identifying frequently touched areas such as lift buttons, handrails, benches and table tops.  Mr Tai said the agency+s officers would figure out the things residents +have to touch in order to move around+.  +That is something that we pay attention to and the cleaning crew might not be so aware of these areas - they will just sweep the floor. But we actually raise their awareness of all these kinds of areas that they need to wipe down.+  Besides working with cleaning service providers, NEA works with households with a family member who has been infected with the coronavirus. The agency advises these families on proper disinfection procedures and assists them in disposing of items that might be contaminated, such as pillowcases and bedsheets.  Also on Monday+s panel were Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli, Professor Wang Linfa, director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Medical School, and Mr Edward D+Silva, chairman of the Public Hygiene Council.","70":"SINGAPORE - Enforcement action has been taken against 21 workplaces which have failed to comply with government advisories on safe distancing measures to reduce the risk of local transmission of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in a statement on Monday (March 23).  Thirteen stop-work orders and eight remedial orders were issued to workplaces which disregarded the need for safe distancing on Monday in the first day of enforcement, MOM said.  These orders will be in place until rectifications are made.  The inspections target workplaces with large groups of workers, such as factories, construction sites, shipyards as well as collaborative workplaces.  MOM also noted that some companies have also adopted other precautionary measures to protect workers+ well-being, such as temperature screening.  The ministry reminded all employers to place their employees on work-from-home arrangements wherever possible, especially for vulnerable employees such as older workers, pregnant workers and those with pre-existing medical conditions.  For roles which require the worker to return to the company, employers should ensure wider physical spacing of at least 1m for work stations and seats in meeting rooms, pantries, rest areas and other congregation points, MOM said.  They should also reduce duration and proximity of physical interactions, stagger working hours, defer non-critical work events and scale down critical work events, and implement or enhance shift or split team operations, MOM added in the statement.  Safe distancing measures should also be clearly communicated to all workers.  Related Story Firms urged to stagger work hours, let staff work from home  +Such measures may require businesses to adjust work processes but are necessary to suppress the spread of Covid-19 and protect our community. We also urge employees to practise social responsibility and stay safe by maintaining good personal hygiene and safe distancing,+ the commissioner for workplace safety and health, Mr Silas Sng, said.  MOM said that these inspections will continue and appropriate enforcement actions against non-compliant workplaces will be taken.  Meanwhile, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) issued a similar advisory on Monday to all financial institutions in Singapore, advising them to implement safe distancing measures in all aspects of their business operations, especially customer touch points.  Financial institutions were advised to encourage all customers to use electronic platforms for financial transactions, limit the number of people waiting at their premises, prioritise service to vulnerable customers as well as collect details of visitors for contact tracing purposes, MAS said.","71":"SINGAPORE - Nine in 10 imported Covid-19 cases in Singapore between Wednesday (March 18) and Friday last week did not show symptoms, like fever, when they had passed through the border checkpoints.  As a result, the cases were detected only later on, the Health Ministry said on Monday (March 23) in response to queries.  It explained that about 90 per cent of the imported cases reported in Singapore during the three-day period saw a doctor at a hospital or general practitioner+s clinic after they returned home.  +They had not displayed symptoms when at the checkpoints,+ it added.  Travellers into Singapore have to walk past thermal scanners, which would help identify those who are feverish. Those who are observed to be so, or have other respiratory symptoms will be required to do a Covid-19 swab test.  Singapore had 119 cases altogether in those three days, with 87 of them being imported cases, the ministry+s figures show.  There have been mounting concerns that people with coronavirus may not show symptoms, such as fever, dry cough and shortness of breath.  Scientists are calling for urgent studies to determine the proportion of people with coronavirus who show no, or delayed, symptoms, amid fears that the number of silent carriers may be greater than previously thought.  The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that as many as one-third of the people who test positive show delayed symptoms or none at all, citing classified data from the Chinese government.  In line with stiffer border controls to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, travellers entering Singapore, regardless of where they come from, have been given a 14-day stay-home notice since 11.59pm on Friday. It is mandatory even for those who are well.  The ministry had also said on Sunday that an additional precaution will be taken for those who come into close contact with a confirmed case on their flight back.  Related Story Coronavirus: All travellers arriving in Singapore must submit health declaration from Friday  They will be quarantined.  A quarantine order requires the person to stay put in a dedicated room with a toilet.  It is the strictest among the measures and is given to those who are, or are suspected of being, a carrier of the coronavirus.  In contrast, people serving a stay-home notice will not require a dedicated room and toilet, but they must stay home at all times.  Border control measures in Singapore will be intensified from 11.59pm on Monday (March 23) in a further effort to reduce the risk of importing coronavirus cases.  All short-term visitors, including tourists, will be barred from entering or transiting through Singapore.  Also, work-pass holders and their dependants will be allowed to return to Singapore only if they are employed in sectors that provide essential services, such as healthcare and transport.","72":"SINGAPORE - Enhanced social distancing measures were announced last Friday (March 13), gatherings are now being limited to 250 people at a time. Some people have asked if it is still safe to go swimming, in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Q: Is it safe to go swimming during this period? Can the virus be transmitted through water?  A: It is known that the virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets and saliva, but there is currently no evidence suggesting that the virus can be spread through water, hence making swimming one of the safer sporting activities.  Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam also suggests that it is generally safe to go swimming, as the water and chlorine within swimming pools could help to kill the virus.  People, however, should be mindful of their interactions with others outside the water.  Professor Paul Tambyah from the Department of Medicine at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine noted media reports about an infection cluster in a South Korean church that sprayed saltwater in its churchgoers\u2019 mouths. However, this incident does not provide clear evidence suggesting that the virus can be transmitted via water, he said.  Prof Tambyah also said that it is not known as to how long the virus can survive in plain water, and there have been no cases of viral transmission through plain water.  Thus, citing the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, Prof Tambyah concludes that recreational activities in water is generally safe.  Q: What precautions should one take outside the swimming pool?  A: Individuals should practise good basic hygiene by refraining from sharing towels, and showering before entering the pool, said Prof Tambyah. He also cautioned that individuals should avoid public pools when they are unwell.  It should be noted that those given stay-at-home orders should remain home at all times. If they leave their homes, they will be guilty of breaking the law.  As common facilities such as locker rooms and showers may be crowded, showering at home could be a safer precautionary measure.  Dr Leong also advised individuals to avoid lingering around the pool area, and to go home directly after swimming.  Those who need to use public shower facilities should opt for a single shower cubicle, he added  SportsSG has also regulated the number of people using the Active SG swimming pools at any one point in time, and closed off children pools until further notice.  These precautionary measures were implemented in line with the advisory issued by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on March 13, which said that sports centres with indoor facilities should limit the number of patrons and introduce physical separation measures, on top of increased cleaning frequency and issuing advisories to reduce unnecessary contact.  Related Story Coronavirus: Physical distancing measures at public sports facilities face hurdles  Q: Are lane segregation measures introduced effective against the spread of the virus?  A: Lane segregation has been implemented at running tracks and swimming pools, in line with the precautionary measures that came into force on March 15.  This means that several running lanes are cordoned off at various stadiums, restricting runners to a few available lanes.  ActiveSG swimming pools have placed lane ropes restricting swimming to the length of the pool. Certain lanes have been allocated for swimming classes and lap swimming, while the remaining are available to the rest of the swimmers.  Experts have warned that while such social distancing measures make sense, people should still be wary of possible overcrowding situations.","73":"SINGAPORE - While the Republic continues to ramp up its fight against the coronavirus outbreak, it cannot drop its guard against its old foe, dengue, said Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli on Monday (March 23) at a panel discussion organised by The Straits Times on combating the spread of Covid-19 here.  As of Sunday, more than 4,000 people here had been infected with dengue fever, double the number of cases reported for the same period last year.  Worse still, said Mr Masagos, the strain of dengue threatening Singapore today, DENV-3, is one which many here do not have immunity against.  There are four dengue serotypes, with DENV-1 and DENV-2 being behind the outbreaks here. DENV-2 has been the dominant strain since 2016.  Mr Masagos warned: +The last time we had the DENV-3 outbreak was 30 years ago, which means that there+s a generation of us who do not have the antibodies or the immunity against (it)... it+s certainly something to cause alarm.+  He added: +We hope that as much as we are worried about Covid-19, we must not lose sight of ensuring that... we do not become lax.  +Yes, we start washing our hands - it+s fantastic, we don+t leave tissues on the table, but please continue to do the things that we have always been doing year after year to bring down and to keep suppressing the breeding of mosquitoes because that+s the only and best defence against dengue transmission.+  In response to the grim dengue outlook here, the National Environment Agency (NEA) had brought forward the launch of its annual dengue prevention campaign, which typically begins in April or May, to Sunday.  Also on Monday+s panel were Professor Wang Linfa, director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Medical School, Mr Edward D+Silva, chairman of the Public Hygiene Council, and Mr Tai Ji Choong, director of NEA+s Department of Public Cleanliness.  Prof Wang said that those who had previously been exposed to the DENV-1 and DENV-2 strains of dengue are at higher risk of getting a more severe infection from the DENV-3 strain due to a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement.  This occurs when antibodies that are already present in a person from a previous dengue infection bind to a new infectious dengue particle, but instead of neutralising the virus, help it infect the patient more efficiently.  Related Story 2 coronavirus patients test positive for dengue despite not having the mosquito-borne disease  Related Story Singapore faces dengue threat from emergence of little-seen strain  And while there is as yet no scientific evidence linking dengue and Covid-19, it is possible that a dengue infection might weaken a person+s immune system and make one more susceptible to Covid-19, said Prof Wang.  +You just want to keep healthy and avoid any infection, whether it+s dengue or Covid-19... These are two different viruses and two different approaches. But the principle is the same, it+s every citizen+s responsibility,+ he said.  Mr Masagos said: +The point is we don+t want to have two crises to fight.+  He added: +In Singapore, dengue is here to stay. Covid-19 is here but will hopefully go away. We must therefore not lose our sight on something which is also as dangerous, will also cause losses.+","74":"SINGAPORE - Singapore Airlines (SIA) has announced deeper pay cuts for management staff and compulsory no-pay leave for other employees including captains who will have to take a week off every month.  For now, there are no plans for retrenchments, The Straits Times understands.  Hours after SIA announced on Monday that it was cutting 96 per cent of its scheduled capacity till end-April and grounding 138 out of 147 SIA and SilkAir aircraft, chief executive Goh Choon Phong issued a staff circular on the latest cost-cutting moves.  In the note seen by ST, he said that SIA management will take a second round of pay cuts. Instead of 15 per cent as previously announced, Mr Goh said he will take a 30 per cent cut from April 1.  Pay cuts for other affected senior staff will range from 10 to 25 per cent. SIA board members will take a 30 per cent cut in their fees.  Mr Goh added that the airline has also reached agreement with its unions on a set of cost-cutting measures.  These include varying days of compulsory no-pay leave every month for pilots, executives and associates; as well as furlough for staff on re-employment contracts.  The measures will impact about 10,000 staff.  Before the latest measures, SIA had already rolled out a voluntary no-pay leave scheme to staff, including cabin crew.  SIA said its low-cost unit Scoot will also suspend most of its network, resulting in the grounding of 47 of its fleet of 49 aircraft.

Many countries across the world have imposed increasingly tight border controls either on its own citizens or on foreigners visiting the country to contain the virus. Australia, for instance, said last Thursday that it is closing its borders to all visitors indefinitely.  The United States has also closed its borders with Canada and Mexico and banned inbound travellers who had been to any of more than 25 listed countries up to two weeks before their arrival. Singapore on Sunday likewise said that all short-term visitors will no longer be allowed to enter or transit through the country from 11.59pm on Monday.  In this travel-hostile environment, SIA said that it is actively taking steps to build up its liquidity, and to reduce capital expenditure and operating costs.  The measures that it is taking include discussions with aircraft manufacturers to defer upcoming aircraft deliveries and, if agreed, it will consequently defer payment for those aircraft deliveries.

The 75-year-old woman, who had a history of chronic heart disease and hypertension, died in hospital at 7.52am on Saturday.  She had tested positive for the virus on Feb 23.  Known as Case 90, the woman was linked to the cluster at The Life Church and Missions Singapore.  She is the first of two Covid-19 deaths that Singapore has seen.  The second is a 64-year-old Indonesian national who had arrived in Singapore on March 13.  He was referred to as Case 212 and had pneumonia and had a history of heart disease.  According to Shin Min Daily News, the woman, whom it named as Loy Kock Eng, was cremated after a memorial service at Mandai Crematorium that was attended by about 40 family members and friends.  The coffin was handled by two funeral service workers who were wearing masks and personal protective gear.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  The National Environment Agency had in February issued a set of guidelines on the handling of the bodies of those infected with Covid-19.  The protocols stipulate that the bodies must be prepared for cremation or burial by healthcare workers in hospitals. They must also be double-bagged before they are placed in airtight coffins.  The agency has also issued guidelines to funeral directories and parlours for additional precautionary measures at funerals and wakes. These include limiting the number of attendees to below 250 and implementing social distancing.  The woman had reported the onset of symptoms on Feb 9 and sought treatment at a general practitioner+s clinic thrice before she was admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases on Feb 23.  She was confirmed to have Covid-19 the same day and had been in the intensive care unit since and developed serious complications, a Ministry of Health statement had said earlier.  Before she was admitted to hospital, the woman had kept mostly to her home in Bishan Street 12, the ministry had said.  A church friend told Shin Min that the woman had attended The Life Church and Missions Singapore for about three years, and was a reserved person who was active and practised qigong.  The woman is linked to the second-largest virus cluster in Singapore, with 33 patients and comprising two church sub-clusters. One is The Life Church and Missions Singapore, which had nine other patients, while the other is the Grace Assembly of God church, which had 23 patients.","76":"SINGAPORE - In a move to help the international community combat the coronavirus pandemic, the Government will be making the software for its contact-tracing application TraceTogether, which has already been installed by more than 620,000 people, freely available to developers around the world.  In a Facebook post on Monday (March 23), Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative Vivian Balakrishnan said that the app, developed by the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) and the Ministry of Health, will be open-sourced.  This means that the software+s source code will be made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.  +We believe that making our code available to the world will enhance trust and collaboration in dealing with a global threat that does not respect boundaries, political systems or economies,+ said Dr Balakrishnan, who is also Foreign Minister.  +Together, we can make our world safer for everyone.+  Launched last Friday, the TraceTogether app can identify people who have been within 2m of coronavirus patients for at least 30 minutes, using wireless Bluetooth technology. Its developers say the app is useful when those infected cannot recall whom they had been in close proximity with for an extended duration.  For the app to start tracing, the Bluetooth setting on mobile phones has to be turned on.  If a user gets infected, the authorities will be able to quickly find out the other users he has been in close contact with, allowing for easier identification of potential cases and helping curb the spread of the virus.  Official contact tracers will provide a code that users can match with a corresponding verification code on their app. Once authenticated, users will get a PIN that allows data to be submitted.  Contact tracers will not ask for any personal financial details or request that money be transferred over the phone.  In his post on Monday, Dr Balakrishnan said that the GovTech team was working +around the clock+ to finalise documents to allow others to use the BlueTrace protocol - the building blocks of the TraceTogether app. He added that TraceTogether has been installed by more than 620,000 users so far.

Some are serving a 14-day leave of absence after returning from trips abroad during the holidays, as part of stricter measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus announced by the Ministry of Education (MOE) last week.  The leave of absence would apply to students and staff of schools, pre-schools and student care centres who returned from overseas on or after March 14, MOE had said.  Students who have to miss classes will be supported through home-based learning programmes.  The Straits Times has contacted the ministry for more information.  Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said in a Facebook post on Monday afternoon that additional safe distancing measures are in place in schools, after visiting a few of them in the morning.  These include exam-style seating for pupils from Primary 3; fixed group-cluster seating for Primary 1, Primary 2 and MOE kindergarten children; wipe-down routines; and assigned seating in canteens and play areas.  +Schools seemed a bit quieter with some students serving their leave of absence or stay-home notice,+ said Mr Ong. +But they all took the precautionary measures in their stride. They understand that the measures are necessary to keep them safe.+  He added: +We are doing our best to keep students and staff safe in school so that students can continue learning in a familiar environment, with a familiar routine. Let us all do our part to make that happen.+  Many parents have recently voiced their concerns, with some asking why the holidays were not extended, prompting Mr Ong to address such issues in an earlier post on Facebook on Sunday.  The minister cited scientific evidence, the extra precautions and a desire to reduce disruptions as key considerations in allowing students to resume classes.  On Monday, some parents made efforts to avoid the morning crowds, while others said they hoped the ministry would give students a home-based learning option, given the evolving situation.  Housewife Joanna Tan, 40, said she usually takes a public bus with her seven-year-old daughter to Paya Lebar Methodist Girls+ School (Primary). But they left the house 10 minutes earlier on Monday morning to catch a less crowded bus, and arrived at the school at 7am.  +After school, we also walked one bus stop up so we wouldn+t have to wait with the crowds.+  Madam Priscilla Yeow, 44, said her Secondary 2 son and Primary 6 daughter also went to school on Monday.  +We+re definitely worried and the situation around the world is very bad. But I think our Government has implemented good border controls and schools are taking a lot of precautions, like suspending co-curricular activities,+ she said.

But the spike in the number of imported cases last week made some parents like Madam Diana Ismail decide to keep their children at home instead.  The 41-year-old business owner+s four sons will stay at home this week while she monitors the situation. One of them is in pre-school, another in primary school and the oldest two are in secondary school.  +My concern is that some parents had gone abroad and are now on stay-home notice, but their children can still go to school if they didn+t travel,+ she said.  Madam Diana added: +My sons are in four different schools and they have to take public transport, so I just want to minimise any possible contact with more people... My mum, who lives with us, is in her 60s and not in good health, so I have to take care of her too.+  Perhaps the March school break could have been extended by a week or two, and the June holidays could be used for lessons to make up for the curriculum time lost, she suggested.  +Wouldn+t it be simpler for everyone to have e-learning, and maybe employers could allow parents to take turns to work from home in this pandemic?+    Pei Chun Public School pupils queueing up in their school+s canteen.

The move is aimed at freeing up capacity at public hospitals so they can take care of the more seriously ill Covid-19 patients.  The transferred patients were ones who were no longer sick, or needed less medical care, but were still shedding the virus.  They will be discharged once they are confirmed to be clear of the virus and no longer risk spreading the disease.  Mount Elizabeth Hospital is the first of four Parkway hospitals to take in Covid-19 patients from the public sector, said Dr Noel Yeo, senior vice-president of Parkway\u2019s hospital operations in Singapore.  The number of new infections here, especially imported ones, has been fairly high as residents return from high-infection countries.  There are now more than 300 Covid-19 patients hospitalised here.  The Health Ministry said that it expected the number of Covid-19 cases in Singapore to increase, and had plans in place to deal with increased demand for hospital and clinical services.  It has activated a collaboration between public and private hospitals to transfer well and stable Covid-19 patients to selected private hospitals so that capacity in the public sector may be freed for the management of more severe cases.  Over the past three days, the National Centre for Infectious Diseases had transferred 20 patients to Concord International Hospital, in addition to 29 patients to Mount Elizabeth Hospital, via dedicated ambulances, it said in a statement on Monday.  Obstetricians at Parkway East had expressed concerns that the ward for the Covid-19 patients is on the same floor as the maternity ward.  However, Dr Yeo said: \u201cThe same stringent safety protocols and precautionary measures will apply for these new patients, who will be housed in a single ward at the hospital.\u201d  Related Story SGH sets up fever screening area in carpark as cases spike  These patients will not be allowed to leave the ward, nor allowed any visitors. All staff working in areas where the patients are must don protective apparel.  He added that the areas these patients had passed through during the transfer will be thoroughly cleaned and sanitised.  Dr Yeo said: \u201cWe have been working closely with the Ministry of Health on joining the national effort against Covid-19, and how private sector resources may be utilised to alleviate the load on public healthcare institutions.\u201d  He hopes other private sector hospitals will also \u201cplay their part to complement these efforts\u201d.  Last week, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said Singapore has sufficient healthcare facilities and workers to cope with the current number of Covid-19 patients.  He said there are also contingency plans if numbers go up.  These include opening up more wards in public hospitals as well as using quarantine facilities for recovering patients.  MOH said on Monday that there are plans to further collaborate with private hospitals to manage Covid-19 cases, as well as patients with other conditions, to free up capacity in the public sector.","79":"SINGAPORE - All travellers arriving in Singapore - including Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders - must submit an online health declaration before proceeding with immigration clearance, from Friday 9am (March 27).  The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said on Monday that all travellers will have to do so via the SG Arrival Card electronic service.  ICA explained that this new entry requirement is an additional precautionary measure to mitigate the risk of importing Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, into Singapore. It will be subject to further review according to the global Covid-19 situation.  The data from the declarations will be used by the Ministry of Health (MOH) for contact tracing purposes if any traveller becomes a suspected or confirmed coronavirus case. The data will also become part of the traveller\u2019s medical history for reference at local healthcare institutions where these travellers will be treated.  Long-term pass holders refer to those with a student\u2019s pass, dependant\u2019s pass, work pass or long-term visit pass.  ICA+s announcement comes after MOH said on Sunday that all short-term visitors from anywhere in the world will not be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore from Monday, 11.59pm.  The Ministry of Manpower will only allow the entry or return of work-pass holders, including their dependants, who provide essential services, such as in healthcare and transport.  ICA said on Monday that those who do not submit their electronic health declarations before arriving here must fill in and submit their forms electronically before they can proceed with immigration clearance. This will unnecessarily delay their immigration clearance, the authority added.  Travellers who provide false declarations can be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act.  The new health declaration function on the SG Arrival Card e-service was developed by ICA in consultation with MOH, and is fully integrated with ICA\u2019s immigration system.  The e-service was rolled out for testing from August last year to allow short-term visitors to submit information about their visit to Singapore digitally before they arrived here.  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore residents who travel overseas may face consequences as Govt ramps up border controls  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  This was to replace the need to fill up paper-based disembarkation\/embarkation cards. ICA said that as of last month, it had cleared more than 560,000 electronic SG Arrival Card records that short-term visitors had submitted.  Singapore residents and long-term pass holders submitting their health declaration will need to select \u201cResidents\u201d on the e-service. They will then be directed to provide their health and recent travel information, as well as personal and contact details.  The health declaration will be made available before Friday as part of the SG Arrival Card e-Service, so that travellers who are due to arrive in Singapore after Friday 9am can complete it before their arrival.  Travellers can submit their health declarations up to three days before arriving here. They must re-submit their health declaration if there are changes to their health conditions or travel histories before arriving in Singapore.  The SG Arrival Card e-service is available at ICA\u2019s website and the service\u2019s free mobile application can be downloaded from the Apple App Store and Google Play store.  ICA added that from Friday 9am, it will end the paper-based disembarkation\/embarkation card.  This means that when entry into Singapore for short-term visitors resumes in the future, these travellers must provide their arrival and departure information through the SG Arrival Card e-service instead.","80":"SINGAPORE - Taxi drivers displaced by the developing coronavirus outbreak will be deployed to lessen crowding on trains, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said on Monday (March 23).  Speaking during a visit to Bright Hill station on Stage 2 of the Thomson-East Coast line (TEL), Mr Khaw said having +temporary transport ambassadors to help commuters keep safe distances+ was an idea mooted by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean.  +These are temporary positions to support higher manpower needs at our stations during this special period,+ Mr Khaw said. +These ambassadors can also help to sanitise our train cabins, seats, poles more frequently.+  During pre-outbreak times, MRT trains could pack as many as four commuters per square metre during peak hours. Although crowding has reduced since the coronavirus forced many to work from home, public transport commuters are still placed well within the 1m distance recommended by the Government for entertainment venues, restaurants, hawker centres and cinemas.  Mr Khaw said: +I would very much like to do the same for buses and trains. Unfortunately, as public transport has to accommodate large numbers of people at the same time, this is very challenging. Almost impossible, unless we can substantially reduce peak-hour demand. I say: Let+s try.+  He said the transport ambassadors could be employed on three or six-month contracts, +depending on how long the pandemic lasts+.  Cabbies who have seen their earnings hit by the Covid-19 pandemic can fill these roles. +The extra cash allowance may also come in handy... to supplement their reduced income,+ Mr Khaw said. He noted that transport operators have seen some of their taxi drivers suffering due to reduced income.  +They are keen to try out the transport ambassador idea, for their taxi drivers,+ the minister said, adding that the Land Transport Authority will work with them to get the scheme running +in the coming weeks+.  +This is our attempt to help one another, within the public transport sector, cope with the pandemic,+ he said. +Regulator, transport operators and unions working together, fighting a common enemy. We will emerge stronger as one transport family.+  He also suggested that displaced cabbies can train to be bus captains.  Taxi drivers and private-hire drivers say their earnings have dropped by as much as 60 per cent since the outbreak hit Singapore in January. Many have given up driving as a result, despite financial aid handed out by the Government and operators.  While no operator would divulge its unhired rate, industry observers reckon it could be as high as 30 per cent. If so, more than 20,000 drivers have given up their vehicles.","81":"SINGAPORE - Stage 2 of the Thomson-East Coast line (TEL) is likely to open after July.  Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said on Monday (March 23) that testing of the six-station stretch will be carried out from April to July.  Speaking during a visit to the Bright Hill MRT station, Mr Khaw said Stage 1 will close early and open later on weekends from April to July. This is to facilitate testing of Stage 2, which comprises six stations - Springleaf, Lentor, Mayflower, Bright Hill, Upper Thomson and Caldecott.  +This will allow us to run trains through the entire stretch of nine stations, from Woodlands North to Caldecott for thorough integrated testing. It is necessary,+ he said.  +We did the same for the Downtown Line, which also opened in stages,+ he added.  In a separate statement, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and SMRT said services on Stage 1 of the TEL - Woodlands North, Woodlands and Woodlands South stations - will close earlier, at 10pm every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and start later at 6.30am every Saturday and Sunday, from April 3 to July 26.  TEL Stage 2 will benefit more than 60,000 households near the six new stations.  The minister also said more needs to be done to reduce crowding on public transport in light of the developing Covid-19 pandemic.  He outlined a few steps: One, do not use public transport if you are unwell, as doing so will endanger other commuters. Two, cut down on unnecessary travels during this period. Three, talk softly, if you need to.  +Best, don+t talk,+ he said. +Let fellow commuters have a quiet journey.+  Talking increases the chance of droplets - a key means of transmission - being dispersed.

Many have done so,+ he said.  Mr Khaw also noted that many were working from home, but more could do so. He noted that two-thirds of the Transport Ministry are working from home, and +productivity is not affected+. In fact, less commuting time means more time for work, he quipped.  He said with telecommunications connectivity, there is little need for people to gather at an office. +I hope post-pandemic, office life for most will no longer be the same,+ he said. +This will reduce peak-hour demand and the pressure on us to add more trains and more lines at great cost to taxpayers and commuters.+  With the shorter operating hours for the existing Stage 1 TEL stations, LTA and SMRT said that this will double the engineering hours to test the systems and trains.

Some returning overseas students said it was a relief to return to Singapore.  At the beginning of the week, fine arts undergraduate student Joshua Lau, 22, said he and his sister Deborah Lau, 23, were still debating whether to leave London, as flight prices were fluctuating every hour.  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore residents who travel overseas may face consequences as Govt ramps up border controls  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  +But when we stepped into Changi, it was a huge mental relief. Our fear was if we had gotten sick in London, we wouldn+t be able to get proper healthcare because we+re international students,+ said Mr Lau, who attends Central Saint Martins in London. His sister is an arts and culture management postgraduate student at King+s College.  He added that he knows of at least 15 other Singaporean students who have flown back home this week.  The flight home was not without drama for Mr Lau, who said some travellers at Gatwick Airport where he was taking his flight had on hazmat suits and raincoats.  He and his sister only wore masks on the flight, as that was all they had.  Back in Singapore, they disinfected their luggage and shoes before stepping into the house and now spend most of their time in separate bedrooms.  +If I want to talk to my family in person, we+ll stand a distance away. Hugs can wait; what+s important is that we+re all back together safely,+ said Mr Lau.  National University of Singapore medical school student Shanisse Tsai, 22, shares the same sentiment.  Ms Tsai, who was in Boston for a four-week internship programme at Harvard Medical School, decided to self-isolate for two weeks despite having arrived a day before the stay-home notice kicked in.  +I went through the airports and various points of contacts, so even though it+s not mandatory for me to stay home, I think the socially responsible thing to do is to isolate myself,+ she said.  She is working on a research project in place of the now-cancelled internship programme, which she had only completed two of the scheduled four weeks. Her family members leave her meals outside her door.  Ms Tsai had initially planned for a two-week vacation after her internship and had bought tickets to the now-postponed music festival Coachella in California as her +last hurrah+ before her final year.  +At first it was quite disappointing to leave because the internship position was really hard to get. But as the situation got more serious in Boston, nothing beats the anticipation to get home; I just wanted to come home as soon as possible,+ she said.  Ms Tsai has started sharing her stay-home experience on social media in addition to keeping touch with her friends over video calls.  She said: +I+m vlogging my life in this small space so after 14 days, I can look back to see what I did and help other people think of things to do in their rooms.+","85":"SINGAPORE - Education Minister Ong Ye Kung responded to parents+ concerns about schools reopening on Monday (March 23), citing scientific evidence, extra precautions, and a desire to reduce disruptions as key considerations in allowing students to resume classes.  His Facebook post on Sunday came after Singapore announced it would bar all short-term visitors from entering or transiting through the country from 11.59pm on Monday, to reduce the risk of imported coronavirus cases.  Said Mr Ong: +Part of the reason for the tougher border measures is to ensure we keep Singapore as safe as possible, so that daily activities, like going to work, eating out and attending school, can go on.+  He noted that he has received many e-mails and messages from parents, with some asking why the March holidays were not extended, especially given the rising numbers of imported Covid-19 cases and impending border closures.  Others, including several students, urged the Ministry of Education (MOE) to keep schools open, as they would like to go to school, he added.  Setting out MOE+s thinking on the matter, he said Covid-19 does not affect the young as much as it does adults - echoing remarks made by Professor Dale Fisher, chair of the World Health Organisation\u2019s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.  +Neither is there evidence to show that the young are vectors or spreaders of the virus,+ he said. +The reverse appears to be the case, where the young get infected by adults at home.+  None of the students in Singapore who contracted Covid-19 caught it from school, he added.  +In this context, it may not be a bad idea for our children to spend the bulk of their day in school, where lessons and activities are arranged such that they mingle only with their classmates, who are less susceptible to the virus than adults,+ Mr Ong said.  +They will be quite a resilient group. If we close schools, many will not stay home, but may run around in the community and mingle with a lot more people, exposing themselves to more risk.+  The minister also said closing schools would also disrupt the lives of many people, particularly parents who are both working, and who have limited childcare options.  +We are particularly concerned about parents who are healthcare workers and providers of essential services.+  Related Story Children less likely to be sick from Covid-19: Professor  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Various measures will help keep students safe, he said, pointing to the Government+s existing leave of absence and stay-home notice policy, as well as checks on people+s travel history at school gates, which will be done as an extra precaution.  Students will also only spend their time with those in their classes, with co-curricular activities suspended for two weeks.  They will sit apart in class and be reminded to wash their hands regularly and avoid touching their faces.  Those who are not feeling well - be it with a cough or sore throat - will be placed in an isolation room or sent home, he added.  +Implemented together, these measures will serve as a robust layer of system defence, complementing the natural defence children may already have, to enable school to continue,+ he said.","86":"Children appear to be asymptomatic or less likely to be sick from Covid-19 than adults, which is why there is no real reason to close schools for now, says Professor Dale Fisher, group director of medicine at the National University Health System and chair of the World Health Organisation+s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.  He shares more.  Q Why do children seem to be less affected by Covid-19 than adults?  A We know that there are other diseases where children are not affected as much. For instance, chicken pox is a much milder illness in children than in adults.  And a child with Hepatitis A (a viral liver disease) probably does not have symptoms, but they might have antibodies if you test them, whereas adults with Hepatitis A will develop fever and jaundice.  So, we know that children and adults have a different sort of immune system. The children could be - for reasons we do not yet understand - less likely to have symptoms.  If studies done to find out if children have antibodies to Covid-19 show that there are a lot of asymptomatic children, it will prove - but it will not tell us why - that children are getting infected but not showing symptoms.  Q Should we worry about children passing Covid-19 to the elderly?  A That is another question we do not yet know the answer to. However, if they are asymptomatic, they are less likely to do so.  In fact, a lot of the swabs that we have taken from family clusters have shown that while the parents might have had the disease and had symptoms, the children are completely well, even though they tested positive.  We have no evidence that the child in those family clusters was the first person to get it.  If you are asymptomatic, you are much less likely to spread it because you are not coughing, you are not making the droplets. Is it theoretically possible to spread it if you share a pair of chopsticks, for instance? We think it is probably theoretically possible, but it is certainly not a major driver of the outbreak. The money is on people with symptoms spreading the disease before they are diagnosed and isolated.  It is more the other way around - the parents have infected the child and the child is asymptomatic, but you can find (the virus) in their throat.  If you are asymptomatic, you are much less likely to spread it because you are not coughing, you are not making the droplets.  Is it theoretically possible to spread it if you share a pair of chopsticks, for instance?  We think it is probably theoretically possible, but it is certainly not a major driver of the outbreak.  The money is on people with symptoms spreading the disease before they are diagnosed and isolated.  So, if that period is a week, they are going to spread it a lot. If it is two days, they will not spread it so much.  If it is two days where they stayed home because they were not feeling well, then they will spread the disease to even fewer people, or to no one.  We know that younger people are unlikely to get serious illness, but they can be an important part of transmission and every young person in Singapore has parents and grandparents who are older.  Everyone needs to pull together to do their part, to help save lives.","87":"SINGAPORE - More than 4,000 people in Singapore have been infected with dengue fever this year - double the number of cases reported for the same period in 2019.  The surge in cases, ahead of the traditional peak dengue season between June and October, has been fuelled by several factors - the rise of a less common dengue virus serotype, as well as warmer temperatures and more rain which have caused the population of the Aedes aegypti mosquito to multiply.  +This unusually high number of cases outside the typical peak dengue period is a cause for concern for all of us. Entering the warmer months of the year, there could be more instances of transmission,+ said Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli at the launch of the National Dengue Prevention Campaign in Ang Mo Kio on Sunday (March 22).  The National Environment Agency+s (NEA) annual campaign typically begins in April or May, but was started earlier this year in view of the grimmer dengue outlook.  The island has seen 300 to 400 new cases a week since the start of the year. There are now about 100 active dengue clusters across the island, including 28 +red+ clusters which have at least 10 cases of the mosquito-transmitted virus. Parts of Jurong West and Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 are within these high-risk areas.  Dengue fever is caused by four different virus serotypes, or strains. Outbreaks here tend to be caused by the DENV-1 serotype as well as DENV-2, the main dengue virus serotype in the island since 2016.  But DENV-3 infections have been rising in the past four months. In February, they made up 48 per cent of cases, almost double the 26 per cent for DENV-2 cases.  Mr Masagos said that since Singapore has not had a dengue outbreak driven by DENV-3 in almost three decades, the population+s immunity to this particular serotype is lower.  It is +still too early+ to tell if there has been a switch of predominant dengue virus type, and the NEA is monitoring the situation closely, he added.  Related Story Dengue outbreak possible with rise of DenV-3, a virus type not dominant in more than 30 years  Related Story NEA boosts dengue fight with new mozzie breeding facility  +We have a less common dengue virus serotype emerging and lower immunity against it, and second, we have more Aedes mosquitoes carrying this virus. This has resulted in a higher number of dengue cases, which in turn increases the chances of dengue transmission. So that is the third reason for the surge in dengue cases we are seeing...+  +If the three factors I mentioned persist, this number could rise beyond the historical weekly peak of 891 cases recorded in July 2014, during the peak season.+  Dengue fever, which can cause a very high fever, severe headache and joint and muscle pains, claimed 20 lives last year.  The NEA has been taking steps to fight dengue, Mr Masagos said.  From January to February, it conducted 161,000 inspections in public areas and housing estates and discovered about 3,200 mosquito breeding habitats, most of which were in people+s homes.  At the start of the year, the environment agency also laid 14,000 Gravitraps in newly completed Housing Board blocks and landed housing estates. More than 64,000 of these devices islandwide trap adult female Aedes mosquitoes that are looking for places to lay their eggs, and also stop young mosquitoes in these traps from emerging.  +With better surveillance and analytics capabilities,+ Mr Masagos added, +we have observed a 90 per cent increase in the detection rate of Aedes larval habitats found in homes for the past three years.+  But everyone must continue to do their part to keep the community safe, he said.  +In some of the large dengue clusters, NEA had detected repeated mosquito breeding in the same homes despite giving multiple alerts to residents. I therefore appeal to residents to do your part to remove potential breeding habitats in your homes, to keep you and our communities safe.+  People are encouraged to reduce the spread of dengue - for example by ensuring that stagnant water does not gather in potential mosquito breeding areas such as flower-pot plates, pails and litter such as discarded drink cans. Aedes mosquitoes can breed in bodies of stagnant water as small as a 20-cent coin.  Over the past three years, more than 3,000 mosquito breeding habitats have been linked to containers and receptacles that were mostly discarded as litter in public areas.  Mr Masagos added that the SG Clean campaign launched last month +addresses the immediate risks from Covid-19, (but) also sets out to improve public hygiene and cleanliness for the long term+.  The NEA is also putting up posters in HDB lift lobbies to inform residents of upcoming inspections - as well as insecticide spraying - for all homes in dengue clusters.  +I ask for your cooperation with NEA officers. Let them carry out the checks and spraying in your homes. We should also inform our family, neighbours and friends about these efforts so that they are aware and lend support,+ the minister added.  Grassroots leader Eric Chua, 44, chairman of Yio Chu Kang Zone 3 RC, leads a team of volunteers who go door-to-door to raise awareness of the disease. Volunteers visit homes two times a year \u2013 and three or four times if these are in more high-risk areas.  He said: \u201cAng Mo Kio is a mature estate. There are many seniors, and some are staying alone. Sometimes it can be a bit challenging to spread the message to them as well. Youngsters have a lot of platforms for information \u2013 such as social media \u2013 but some seniors may not know the seriousness (of the situation).\u201d  He stressed the importance of taking precautions \u2013 even as public attention has been occupied by the coronavirus outbreak in Singapore.  IT technician Viknesh Jayasekaran, 34, who lives near a high-risk dengue cluster in Ang Mo Kio, takes the usual precautions \u2013 leaving pails upturned and emptying water from the plates below plant pots \u2013 even as he said he is more worried about the coronavirus.  ","88":"An appeal by the authorities for businesses to implement stricter and mandatory social distancing to contain the spread of the coronavirus gained some momentum yesterday as a number of restaurants, hotels, supermarkets, nightclubs and cinemas put in place measures to keep customers farther apart.  A Golden Village (GV) cinemas spokesman said its managers will be putting in place measures as required by the authorities.  +On top of what GV has already implemented on the compulsory seat gap, we will be blocking out more seats in all our cinema halls,+ he added.  Several tables at the Shake Shack hamburger joint in Neil Road were marked with a cross and left empty to seat patrons farther apart. A staff member checked the temperatures of customers before allowing them to stay in line to wait for their tables.  The hamburger joint+s branch at Jewel in Changi Airport had black tape on the floor placed a metre apart so people could keep a distance while queueing.  +We should do whatever we can in making sure the epidemic curve is flattened,+ said university student Gayya Subra, 26, who was in the queue. She was referring to the popular theory of slowing down the infection rate so that healthcare systems will not be overwhelmed, buying time for interventions, such as a vaccine to be made.  Nightclub Zouk, which remains open, is limiting its capacity in each of its four venues to 250 people, including staff. Each room has its own stamp to ensure that guests do not move from room to room - a policy that started on Friday.  STRICTER RULES  The Government announced stricter guidelines on Friday, suspending all events and gatherings with 250 or more participants until June 30, while the suspension of all social activities for seniors by government agencies will be extended for another two weeks until April 7.  Events with fewer than 250 people and operators of venues such as restaurants and cinemas must implement measures to ensure separation of at least a metre between patrons. The measures will apply across the board for all events, including religious and private gatherings.  Retailers and food and beverage outlets will also be required to keep patrons at least a metre apart. For instance, operators are encouraged to demarcate queues to ensure patrons keep their distance while dining outlets should ensure alternate seats are marked out.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  The Government said the measures were mandatory and would be enforced.  The exhortations did not go unnoticed.  At a wedding at The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore, newly-weds who would identify themselves only as Mr and Mrs Tan split their guests into two groups - one in the ballroom and the other in an area outside.  The tables were also placed at least a metre apart and they each had only about six guests instead of the usual 10. Guests were also served food on individual plates so there was no sharing.  +We do feel safe attending the wedding,+ said guest Nur+Ashikin Ahmad, a 32-year-old accountant, who turned up with her husband and two-year-old daughter.  Some restaurants even cancelled reservations to avoid overcrowding. Michelin-starred Burnt Ends rang yesterday morning to turn away at least one group of guests as it needed to keep patrons a metre apart, which meant it could not have the usual number of tables.  Customer Chelsea Lim, who had her reservation cancelled, told The Sunday Times: +It+s good they do this and show everyone that it+s possible for F&B businesses to do something to tackle the virus too.+  Ms Lim, 29, thought the one-metre rule was a good thing and that it was better +to be safe than sorry in this climate+.

Work pass holders and their dependants will be allowed to return to Singapore only if they work in sectors that provide essential services such as healthcare and transport.  This will also kick in at 11.59pm on Monday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a statement on Sunday.  The measures were announced a day after two patients - a 75-year-old Singaporean woman and a 64-year-old Indonesian man - died from Covid-19 due to complications. They were the first deaths the Republic has seen in the Covid-19 outbreak.  National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said at a briefing on Sunday morning that the measures to +significantly tighten+ Singapore+s borders are taken in the light of the rapidly escalating virus outbreak around the world.  Previously, except for a handful of countries, short-term visitors from elsewhere were allowed to come into Singapore but were issued a 14-day stay-home notice (SHN) upon arrival.  This meant, however, that resources were being expended to serve and enforce SHNs on them, and if they fell ill, to provide them with medical treatment. On Saturday, there were still 533 short-term visitors arriving in Singapore.  To date, there are more than 260,000 Covid-19 cases across 185 countries, and around 11,200 deaths.  The MOH said that in Singapore, almost 80 per cent of new Covid-19 cases over the past three days were imported, most of them Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning home from abroad.  These imported cases had travel histories to 22 different countries.  There were 432 cases of coronavirus patients in Singapore as of Saturday evening. A total of 140 cases have fully recovered. Of the 290 patients still in hospital, most are stable or improving, but 14 are in critical care.  On the limited entry for work pass holders and their dependants, the Manpower Ministry will allow this only for those in essential services.  On what constitutes essential services, Mr Wong said the Ministry of Manpower will continue to approve applications for the workers to come back according to existing rules, with inputs from relevant government agencies when needed.  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore residents who travel overseas may face consequences as Govt ramps up border controls  He added that foreign domestic helpers could also be considered as offering essential services, especially in cases where they are needed to help look after children or the elderly.  As previously announced, all Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders returning will continue to be issued a 14-day SHN.  In addition, Malaysians with Singapore work permits can continue to work in the Republic during this period, with accommodation arrangements.  Transport of goods between both countries will also be facilitated, the Singapore-Malaysia Special Working Committee has agreed.  Diplomats accredited and based in Singapore can continue to come in. They will also be subjected to the 14-day isolation.  On Sunday, Mr Wong said that these were very significant moves especially for a small open economy like Singapore which has always been connected to the world.  +But this is an unprecedented crisis,+ he said.  He noted that while very few short-term visitors have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, they can take up enforcement and medical resources.  +During this time, we have to focus our resources on returning Singaporeans,+ he said.  On how long these measure will remain in place, he said: +I can+t say at this stage. No one will know how long this current wave of imported cases we are experiencing will last for.+  He added: +It depends on how long the outbreak is going to continue in Europe and America, which are now the new epicentres for the virus outbreak. It (also) depends on how long more we will see returning Singaporeans coming back, so we will monitor on a day by day basis.+  Mr Wong also warned that the Government is considering measures against those who choose to travel overseas despite the border control measures.  +I don+t think we can allow this to continue. We are discussing what additional measures may be needed,+ he said, adding that work pass holders who leave Singapore at this time may face the consequence of not being allowed entry later.  In recent days, most of the new patients in Singapore have been imported cases, that is, returning residents and long-term pass holders with travel history to Europe, North America, South-east Asia and other parts of Asia.  Besides strict border controls, rigorous contact tracing, quarantine and home isolation, the Government has implemented safe distancing measures such as smaller crowd sizes and keeping safe spaces around individuals, especially vulnerable segments of the population like the elderly.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  For example, all events and gatherings with 250 or more participants are to be suspended until June 30, while the suspension of all social activities for seniors by government agencies will be extended for another two weeks until April 7.

In his opening remarks at the briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, he included the following health tips:  First, eat a health and nutritious diet, which helps your immune system to function properly.  Second, limit your alcohol consumption, and avoid sugary drinks.  Third, do not smoke, he said, as smoking damages your lungs and can increase your risk of developing severe disease if you become infected with Covid-19.  Fourth, exercise. WHO recommends 30 minutes of physical activity a day for adults, and one hour a day for children.  If allowed, go outside for a walk or a run, while keeping a safe distance from others.

The protocols include double-bagging the bodies before they are placed in airtight coffins.  The agency has also issued guidelines to funeral directories and parlours for additional precautionary measures at funerals and wakes. These include limiting the number of attendees to below 250 and implementing social distancing.  The guidelines have taken on more resonance following the deaths of two patients on Saturday morning (March 21 ) - a 75-year-old Singaporean woman and a 64-year-old Indonesian man - due to Covid-19 complications.  They are the first deaths Singapore has seen from the outbreak.  The guidelines on the handling of bodies were issued by NEA in consultation with the Health Ministry (MOH) on Feb 7 to relevant funeral services companies.  The agency also stated that collecting, casketing and transporting bodies for cremation or burial will be restricted to companies whose employees have undergone the basic infection control course by the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.  Funeral service company employees are to be properly protected when they carry out their work.  Funerals and wakes for those who died of Covid-19 are allowed as long as there is no contact with the body, said NEA.  +However, to minimise any risk posed by contact between potentially large number of visitors during the wake, families will be advised to keep the funeral wakes short,+ said NEA, adding that families should also abide by the latest MOH guidelines on events and gatherings involving large groups of participants at any one time.  In the light of this, NEA has also asked funeral services companies to offer other options to families, such as holding prayers just before the cremation, for example, at the service hall in Mandai Crematorium.  Burials are allowed if there are strong religious reasons for it, added NEA.  There is a list of funeral services companies that are able and willing to handle the bodies of those infected with Covid-19. Hospitals will advise affected families when such information is required, said NEA.  If the dead patient is a foreigner, families can cremate the body and transport the ashes back to their home countries. No special permit is needed to repatriate cremated ashes.  On Friday, NEA also issued advisories to funeral directories and parlours to implement additional measures at funerals and wakes, including temperature screenings, visitor registration and safe distancing measures.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  For example, gatherings in funeral or wake spaces should be limited to less than 250 people at any one time and there needs to be physical spacing of at least 1m between attendees.

Singapore reported its first two deaths from the coronavirus on Saturday. On Friday, officials confirmed 40 new Covid-19 cases, bringing the total number of infected patients on the island to 385. A carpark at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) was converted on Friday to help screen patients for fever to help alleviate the load on the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.  The contents of the circular on Thursday provided guidance on the approach doctors should take when managing foreign patients holding Asean passports who are seeking specialist medical care in the country.  The circular added that specialists who feel it is necessary for a foreign patient to remain in Singapore can apply to the MOH for a waiver.  To qualify, the patient must have healthcare needs that cannot be met in his home country and be already under the specialist+s active care. The specialist must certify that delays in the treatment of the patient will lead to +serious adverse outcomes+, the circular said.  Related Story Coronavirus: Asean travellers rush to enter Singapore before border restrictions affecting them kick in  Other foreign patients who live in Asean and wish to have continued specialist care in Singapore must apply for the Asean Health Clearance (AHC) prior to their medical appointment.  They must not have visited any hospital outside Singapore 14 days before the application to be eligible for the AHC.  From Monday (March 16), the Government said that the AHC has to be submitted by all short-term visitors who are Asean nationals at least 14 to 21 days before their intended date of travel into Singapore, and should be approved by the MOH before they begin their trip to Singapore.  These approved applications will be verified by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority at the border.  However, the circular also noted that in some cases of medical emergencies involving the evacuation of Asean passport holders, the requirement for the AHC can be waived.  MOH had earlier announced that all travellers entering the Republic from 11.59pm on Friday (March 20) will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice.  Short-term visitors who arrive in the country without the necessary approval, or proof of the place where they will serve their 14-day stay-home notice, or do not meet prevailing entry requirements, will be unable to enter Singapore.","95":"SINGAPORE - Singaporean John Png, 44, is glad he stayed put in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus pandemic erupted.

The Ministry of Health had announced measures to reduce the risk of local transmission of the coronavirus, including requiring public venues like eateries, shops and cinemas to keep patrons at least 1m apart.  Though the measures were to be rolled out progressively from Saturday, preparations had already begun at several businesses.  Casual restaurant chain Collin+s has already moved out around 10 per cent of its tables in its Nex shopping mall outlet to ensure adequate spacing between groups of diners.  Mr Jonathan Lim, 48, chief development officer at SF Group, Collin+s parent company, said: +It+s a bit of a sacrifice and dine-in business has been impacted slightly. But we try to cope by having more offers to draw customers to dine during off-peak hours.+  Chinese restaurant Soup Restaurant managing director Wong Wei Teck, 64, similarly said it started implementing the 1m safety distance and collecting diners+ details for contact tracing at two of its 15 outlets. It intends to implement the measures at all outlets by the end of next week.  +We+re a family restaurant and we frequently get big groups. It can be little bit troublesome for customers but it+s safety first,+ said Mr Wong.  Meanwhile, Koi operations project manager Lim Zhi Liang, 34, said that at outlets with self-order touchscreen kiosks, staff will space them at least 1m apart and disinfect the touchscreens every 15 to 30 minutes. Floor markers will be rolled out across all 57 outlets over the next few days.  Over at Zouk in Clarke Quay, the nightspot is limiting the capacity in each of its four venues - Zouk main room, Capital, Phuture and Redtail - to 250 people each, including staff. Guest information will also be collected for contact tracing.  Mr Seah Kian Peng, group chief executive of FairPrice Group, said that 1m floor markers at the checkout counters and storewide announcements every 30 minutes to remind customers to space themselves would be progressively implemented at all 148 FairPrice outlets. He said, however, that there are no plans at the moment to limit the number of shoppers in stores.  NEA and town councils are also in the process of marking out seats at hawker centres to guide patrons on how to practise safe distancing.  To help businesses comply with the new requirements, Enterprise Singapore, the National Environment Agency, the Singapore Food Agency and the Singapore Tourism Board issued two joint advisories on Friday with steps the firms can take.  For instance, it said retail shops may use floor markers, along with clear signage, to indicate queuing positions for fitting rooms and at cashiers.  Shops may also limit the number of people within the store and let shoppers in progressively though supermarkets are advised not to create queues outside their stores.  Food and beverage establishments were advised to reduce queues outside their outlets by taking down diners+ details and calling them when seats are available. If not possible, the 1m floor markers, with clear signage, should be used to manage the crowd.

A government spokesman at a multi-ministry task force briefing on Friday also said no lockdown is expected in the near future.  There has been an increase in false reports posted and reposted online since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in recent months, with the Government having to make use of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act to clamp down on rumours several times.  In January, two Facebook accounts were told to make corrections to posts claiming that Woodlands MRT station was closed for disinfection because of a suspected Covid-19 case.  SPH Magazines was also asked in January to correct an online post in the HardwareZone forum that falsely claimed a man in Singapore had died from the virus infection, while The States Times Review Facebook page in the same month was instructed to correct a post that claimed Singapore had run out of face masks.","102":"SINGAPORE - A contact-tracing smartphone app has been launched to allow the local authorities to quickly track people who have been exposed to confirmed coronavirus cases.  Dubbed TraceTogether, the app is able to identify people who have been in close proximity - within 2m for at least 30 minutes - to coronavirus patients using wireless Bluetooth technology, said its developers, the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) and the Ministry of Health (MOH), on Friday (March 20).  +This is especially useful in cases where the infected persons do not know everyone whom they had been in close proximity with for an extended duration,+ said its developers.  While use of the app is not compulsory, those who use it have to turn on the Bluetooth settings in their phones for tracing to be done. They also need to enable push notifications and location permissions in the app, which is available on the Apple App Store or the Google Play store.  Should one of these users be infected, MOH will be able to quickly find out which other users they have been in close contact with, allowing for easier identification of potential cases and helping to curb the spread of the coronavirus here.  On its website, TraceTogether+s developers said the app is meant to complement current contact-tracing methods and allow for the identification of people who were in close proximity with an infected person more efficiently. There is currently no target for the number of users for the app.  In a release on Friday, the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO) said users have to give explicit consent to participate in TraceTogether, and for their mobile number and data to be used for contact tracing.  +When requested by MOH, users can send their TraceTogether logs to facilitate the contact tracing process. Up to that point, the authorities, including MOH and GovTech, have no knowledge of the user+s TraceTogether data,+ said SNDGO.  Official contact tracers will provide a code that users can match with a corresponding verification code on their app. Once authenticated, users will be given a PIN that allows submission of logs when entered.  Official contact tracers will also not ask for any personal financial details or request for the transfer of money over the phone.  When contacted by contact tracers, that is the point that users will be asked to share their data logs. If they refuse, they may be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act.  Related Story Interactive: How coronavirus is spreading across the world  On its website, TraceTogether developers said that keeping the app running all the time will not drain a phone+s battery significantly.  The only data that is collected by the Government through this app is the user+s mobile number, which is kept so that MOH can contact users quickly if they were in close proximity with an infected case.  The app also does not collect or use users+ location data, but only records who they might have been close to.  Similar apps have been said to be successful in helping to turn the tide against the coronavirus in some countries.  In highly-connected South Korea, for instance, people know quickly when a new coronavirus case is found in their neighbourhood through a government alert sent to their mobile phones. This alert includes details such as the new patient+s age, gender and travel history.    Scan the QR code to download the TraceTogether app.    The World Health Organisation and experts said that the country+s extensive tracing, testing and isolation measures have helped to significantly reduce the virus+s spread.

He noted that according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), individuals who are older or have underlying conditions such as heart disease or diabetes have a higher risk of severe Covid-19 infection.  The suspension applies to all activities organised by community clubs, residents+ committees, senior activity centres, active ageing hubs, Crest centres, the Health Promotion Board and ActiveSG sport centres.

In a post providing more information on the group dated December 2015, the page, which has about 1,000 followers, said there is no official atheist group in NUS.  It also made reference to Christopher Hitchens, the late prominent British-American intellectual who wrote, among other works, the book God Is Not Great.

It was helter-skelter after Malaysia announced a two-week national lockdown on Monday night. The disorder was not just over there but also in Singapore because of the close ties between the two countries.  Students and workers scrambled across the Causeway to beat the lockdown deadline as employers here sought lodgings for their workers.  Like China and Italy, Malaysia has taken drastic action to counter a surge in coronavirus cases, mostly linked to a mass religious event in late February.  When asked if Singapore would consider such a move, which is also in place in France and being considered in London, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong told a press conference on Tuesday that while he could not rule it out, it was not on the cards.  Observers and public health experts say the chaos that ensued after Malaysia+s lockdown showed why such a measure would be warranted only if the outbreak gets out of hand and the benefits outweigh the costs.  Dr Gillian Koh, deputy director for research at the Institute of Policy Studies, told The New Paper: +Singapore+s survival and sustainability depends on borders being open and receiving goods as well as people.  +So the cost of locking down Singapore is very high, both for the economy and for sustaining daily life itself.+  But a recent spike in the number of infections has led to online ire and frustration over people here going on holidays despite advisories to defer non-essential travel.  A record 47 new cases were reported on Wednesday, of which 30 were Singapore residents returning from abroad.  Yesterday, for the first time in five days, the number of new cases dropped, as 32 infections were confirmed, of which 24 were imported, all involving returning Singapore residents.  Arguing why a lockdown was highly unlikely, Dr Koh said: +Even with returning Singaporeans, we have very stringent protocols and all of us do expect them to abide by them... to ensure that we keep the extreme scenario of a lockdown as far away as possible.+  National University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser said it was understandable that Singaporeans felt negatively towards people they deemed socially irresponsible.  Singapore Management University law don Eugene Tan agreed but felt these sentiments would weaken after the outbreak.  Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, infectious diseases programme leader at Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at NUS, said a lockdown is a +nuclear option+ reserved for when community transmission has to be brought under control quickly.  While this seems to have worked for China, which yesterday saw zero new infections in Hubei province for the first time since the virus emerged there, Prof Hsu said lockdowns cannot be done indefinitely.  With the virus spreading in so many countries, it could also still be re-imported.  Whether an outbreak is severe enough to warrant such an extreme measure depends on how much each society can tolerate its costs, said Prof Hsu.  +Sometimes that price is far higher than what the virus can do,+ he added.  TESTING CAPACITY  Making a comparison with South Korea+s approach, which involved expanding its testing capacity rapidly and implementing strict social distancing, Prof Hsu said each country had to find the right balance and use its strengths where possible to control the outbreak.  +We are fortunate that community transmission is low at present, and there is more leeway in terms of what we can do,+ he added.  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore General Hospital to convert part of carpark into fever screening area  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam said it is thanks to the hard work put in earlier during the outbreak that a lockdown is not needed here.  Prof Hsu said what Singapore is doing now is to try to prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed at its current capacity, or what is known as flattening the curve.  But at the same time, he said Singapore can also prepare for a possible surge and try to expand healthcare capacity.  He suggested training people to take over some of the work done by nurses so they can be freed up for other tasks.  +For the regular patients... they can just be isolated in a facility where they can+t transmit the virus but can be monitored and taken care of in a way that doesn+t require the heavy resources of a hospital bed or an isolation room,+ Prof Hsu said.  Dr Leong was optimistic that Singapore could maintain its efforts in fighting the virus over the next three to six months but warned against complacency.  Reminding the public to stay home if unwell and urging them to defer travel plans, he said: +We have all the necessary ingredients to overcome this outbreak. But all this is hanging precariously. If we are not careful, it can be lost at the drop of a hat.+  LISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST","109":"SINGAPORE - Malaysians with Singapore work permits can continue to work in Singapore with health screening and accommodation arrangements made for them, while food and products will continue to be transported across the border smoothly.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Friday (March 20) that Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean spoke with Malaysian Senior Minister and Minister of Defence Ismail Sabri Yaakob on the phone on Thursday to discuss these issues in light of Malaysia+s two-week movement restriction order.  The two Senior Ministers discussed the arrangements to ensure the health of the citizens on both sides of the border, while minimising disruptions to companies, workers and citizens.  The MFA said that Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri assured Mr Teo that Malaysia will facilitate the smooth transport of food, while both sides will ensure the transport of commercial goods across the land checkpoint.  At a separate news conference is Malaysia, the Malaysian minister said: \u201cI understand there were discussions. And both sides have agreed that all workers will continue to work there. The Singapore government has agreed to set up accommodation for them in Singapore for two weeks. So they will go to Singapore and stay at the accommodation prepared for them and when they return to Malaysia. Singapore will screen them.\u201d  Both Senior Ministers are chairing the Special Working Committee on the Covid-19 crisis and agreed to establish three working groups under the committee to coordinate the movement of people, goods and the daily operational issues at land checkpoints.  The Straits Times reported a day earlier that Malaysia would temporarily lift the travel ban on citizens who commute to Singapore for work, on the condition that they are housed on the island for the duration of Malaysia+s ongoing restricted movement order.  Malaysia closed its borders for two weeks on Wednesday in an attempt to curb its rising number of coronavirus cases. All Malaysians have been barred from travelling overseas, including around 300,000 daily travellers who commute to Singapore on a near daily basis for work or study.  With today\u2019s announcement, those with long term passes will now be allowed to leave the country, provided they do not return during the two-week period.

Employers who place their staff on this voluntary LOA will be able to claim daily support under a programme by the MOM aimed at alleviating the companies+ financial burden during the Covid-19 outbreak.  This initiative follows recent, stricter measures imposed by schools to curb the spread of the coronavirus, after more infections and a surge in imported cases were recorded in Singapore.  All students and staff who returned from overseas between last Saturday (March 14) and this Friday will be put on a mandatory 14-day leave of absence from the date of return.  From 11.59pm on Friday, all arriving travellers, including Singaporeans, will face even more stringent measures and will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice.  This means they will not be able to leave their homes for 14 days.  In encouraging companies to voluntarily impose the LOA on Friday, the MOM said: +The Government recognises that many parents have been affected by this national measure due to the need to provide care for their children during this period.  +At the same time, it is a useful precautionary measure for people who have travelled recently to stay away from the workplace to prevent further transmission.+  The MOM said companies should adopt flexible work arrangements to allow these employees to work from home during that whole 14-day period.  It noted that some companies had already voluntarily asked employees to stay home after returning from trips overseas between last Saturday and Friday.  Such companies should continue with existing flexible work and leave arrangements, including asking their employees to use their annual leave to cover the company imposed LOA, said the MOM.  However, for those companies that have not put such measures in place, +employers are encouraged to provide additional paid leave to the employees, if work from home is not feasible+, considering that the LOA option was not known before their employees travelled.  To help these companies, the MOM will allow them to apply for the $100 daily support under the LOA support programme, which covers only employees who are Singaporeans, permanent residents or work pass holders.  Companies can also claim a levy waiver for their affected work pass holders.  Those who are self-employed and who have to put themselves on LOA will similarly be allowed to claim this daily support.  Eligible employers will be able to apply for daily support for each affected employee after their LOA is completed.  However, employers, self-employed Singaporeans and permanent residents will not be able to claim under the support programme if they worked remotely during the LOA period or if the affected employee had to use his or her own annual leave, childcare leave or any other kind of leave to cover the LOA.  Additionally, those who have been placed on stay-home notice upon returning to Singapore and whose travel was not between March 14 to 20 are not eligible for daily support under this programme.  Said the MOM: +As the Covid-19 situation continues to evolve, there may be additional requirements imposed on work pass holders from time to time.+  It urged employers and employees to check the MOM website for the latest advisories.  LISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST","111":"SINGAPORE - Singapore saw fewer job vacancies overall last year but there were still many opportunities in growth sectors, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on Friday (March 20). Going forward, however, the uncertainties this year amid the coronavirus outbreak mean vacancies are likely to fall further, she said.  +Hiring sentiments have weakened which means job seekers will have a more challenging time,+ said Mrs Teo in a Facebook post on the Ministry of Manpower+s report on job vacancies in 2019, released on Friday.  The report showed that despite economic uncertainties, like the United States-China trade war, that resulted in fewer job vacancies, employers were still creating new jobs through business expansion and formation.  A total of 42 per cent of the 52,900 openings available last September were newly created positions from business expansion or formation. The proportion was the same as in the previous year, though the number of openings was lower than the 63,300 available in September 2018.  For this year, Mrs Teo said: +The focus must be to help as many people as possible stay in their current jobs. We can then direct job matching support to those who need it most.  +This is similar to our approach in handling the public health crisis - keep most people away from hospitals, so healthcare workers have the capacity to focus on treating those who have more serious conditions,+ she said.  This is why the $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package announced last month had a strong focus on saving jobs and protecting workers, and any further boost will do likewise, as Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has said, she added.  Mrs Teo added: +This is a tough time. MOM is here to help. Our lines are sometimes overwhelmed, as are our officers. I seek your kind patience as we try our best to respond to everyone who has reached out.+  The MOM report, which is based on a survey of about 15,300 private and public sector organisations, said that the top industries with with high proportions of new positions among vacancies last year were construction, information and communications technology (ICT), and security and investigation.  Other sectors identified by the Government as growth sectors - professional services, financial and insurance services, wholesale trade and healthcare - also saw above average proportions of vacancies for newly created positions.  Among jobs for professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs), the most sought after workers last year were software, Web and multimedia developers; teaching and training professionals and systems analysts.  Related Story More job training support for four sectors hit hardest by Covid-19  Related Story Logistics and supply chain workers can tap new retraining programme for better job prospects  Related Story Fewer job vacancies last year as employers turned cautious: MOM  For non-PMET workers, the top number of openings were for security guards; receptionists, customer service and information clerks; and shop sales assistants.  Skilled workers were increasingly in demand, with the share of vacancies for PMETs rising to 58 per cent last year, up from 53 per cent the previous year.  The proportion has been on the rise since 2013, and MOM said this reflects a growing share of vacancies coming from industries dominated by PMETs, such as public administration and education, ICT, and health and social services.  For PMET vacancies, employers valued candidates+ skills, work experience, and attitude over academic qualifications for about half (46 per cent) of the vacancies.  +This underscores the need for job seekers to reskill and upskill to stay relevant to changing job requirements,+ said MOM in the report.  Mrs Teo also highlighted the jobs-skills mismatch in her post as a longer-term issue that still needs to be tackled.  While business is down, the Government wants to work with employers to reskill and upskill their workers to prepare them for new job opportunities when the economy recovers, she said.  +That may be a long way off, but it+s still a good way to make something out of a very bad situation.+  The lack of necessary specialised skills was the top challenge faced by employers trying to fill PMET vacancies, said MOM. It was cited by employers for four in 10 of the PMET vacancies they had trouble hiring locals for.  Related Story Job-search struggles of vulnerable PMETs aged over 40  Related Story Employment security among top concerns of job seekers: Poll  Other top reasons were candidates lacking necessary work experience, and finding the pay unattractive.  For non-PMET positions which were hard to fill with locals, the top three reasons were candidates finding the pay unattractive, finding the job physically strenuous, or preferring not to do shift work.  In general, PMET openings were easier to fill than non-PMET ones. Some 19 per cent of PMET vacancies were unfilled for at least six months, compared with 41 per cent of non-PMET vacancies.  The overall share of vacancies which remained unfilled for at least six months also fell to 28 per cent last year, the lowest in at least a decade.  National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay said in a Facebook post on Friday that there could still be job opportunities such as in sectors and firms affected by labour supply disruptions.  He said that NTUC is exploring ways to better match people who are unemployed or who have been placed on reduced work hours to such opportunities.  \u201cIt may require some of us to pick up some new skills or require us to make some difficult adjustments but we should hold fast and steady and tide through this difficult period together,\u201d he said.","112":"Q What is a quarantine order?  A A quarantine order is the strictest among the measures and is issued to those who are, or are suspected of being, a carrier of Covid-19.  This means the person has either been tested positive for the virus or has exhibited symptoms after returning from an affected country. They could also have come into close contact with a confirmed patient.  Quarantine usually occurs in the home, but can also be served in dedicated government quarantine facilities or hospitals.  Those under quarantine will be isolated from others, and should monitor their temperatures and report their health status to their quarantine order agent at least three times a day.  For those serving out orders at home, spot checks will be carried out by officers. If found to be non-compliant, they may be required to wear an electronic tag or be detained and isolated in a hospital.  Q What is the penalty for breaching a quarantine order?  A As it is a legal order issued under the Infectious Diseases Act, anyone flouting a quarantine for the first time may be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both, with higher penalties for subsequent breaches.  Q What is a stay-home notice?  A From 11.59pm today, this will apply to all Singapore residents returning to the country for 14 days.  People served the notice will not require a dedicated room and toilet, unlike those under quarantine orders, but they should remain in their place of residence at all times. This means they should not go out even to purchase daily necessities. They should also not invite visitors to their residence.  Their family members may continue to live with them. However, they should observe good personal hygiene practices. If those under a stay-home notice become unwell, they should avoid contact with family members and seek medical attention immediately.  Q What is the penalty for breaching a stay-home notice?  A Singaporeans who breach the notice can be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act. First-time offenders can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both.  Permanent residents and pass holders can have their permits or passes revoked or validity shortened. Students who breach their stay-home notices can also face disciplinary action, including suspension or dismissal.  Q What is leave of absence?  A People on this are advised to stay in their place of residence for 14 days but, unlike those on stay-home notices, can leave to purchase daily necessities or to attend to important personal matters.","113":"SINGAPORE - All regular worship services and gatherings in Anglican parish churches islandwide have been suspended until April 3.  The Anglican Diocese of Singapore said on Thursday (March 19) that this was with immediate effect to +create a two-week break in church gatherings+.  +The Diocesan leadership has closely monitored the escalating Covid-19 situation and makes this contribution towards the concerted national effort to +flatten the coronavirus curve+,+ it said, referring to the graph that shows a lower number of infected cases over time with proper containment measures.  There are currently 27 parishes of varying sizes in the Anglican Diocese of Singapore, with an average weekly attendance of about 21,000.  The churches plan to be open before the weekend of April 4 and 5, the start of Holy Week, which is the week leading up to Easter Sunday on April 12.  In the meantime, online weekend services will be conducted, and pastoral care will given to the elderly and the vulnerable.  The announcement comes after St Andrew+s Cathedral, the oldest Anglican site of worship in Singapore, was closed after one of its members was infected with the coronavirus.  On Wednesday, a notice was put up informing members that the church, located next to City Hall, would be closed from 11.59pm on Wednesday to 11.59pm on April 3 for the affected premises to be professionally disinfected.  It said that it received the information about the case on Wednesday afternoon, and the infected member is currently warded in hospital.  The man had attended the 9am English service held in the Cathedral New Sanctuary on Sunday.  +He had no symptoms of illness and passed the pre-service precautionary screening comprising the health and travel declaration and temperature checks,+ the cathedral+s Covid-19 management team said in the notice.  It also encouraged members to comply with the Ministry of Health (MOH) for contact tracing and seek verification from MOH on the authenticity of calls.  The authorities announced 32 new cases on Thursday, bringing the total number of infected patients here now to 345.  Of these, 159 are imported cases and the remaining 186 cases are locally transmitted cases.","114":"SINGAPORE - With the number of Covid-19 patients rising in the past week and going up by double digits in recent days, a carpark at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) will be used to screen patients for fever, to help alleviate the load.  On Friday (March 20), the hospital will extend its fever screening area by converting part of its multistorey carpark H for the purpose.  It will be manned by staff from all six of the hospital+s medical divisions, as well as the nursing and allied health departments.  The move was announced on Thursday in an internal note to staff seen by The Straits Times and confirmed by an SGH spokesman.  Signed off by SGH chief executive officer Kenneth Kwek and medical board chairman Ruban Poopalalingam, the note said that the new screening area will help to manage the growing number of patients infected with the coronavirus nationally.  On Thursday, Singapore recorded 32 new cases. This was slightly lower than the 47 cases recorded the day before, the highest daily number since the start of the outbreak.  Singapore now has a total of 345 cases.  On Monday, the National Centre for Infectious Diseases saw unusually long queues, with people seeking Covid-19 testing without appointments or prior consultation at a clinic.  In the letter, Professor Kwek and Associate Professor Ruban said: +You would have read about the spike in the number of new Covid-19 cases in Singapore, setting a new high every day. This is a situation that we have anticipated and have been planning to meet the increased need for care.  +We are able to manage the surge because of all your efforts. Many of you have stretched yourselves physically, mentally, emotionally and psychologically and we are deeply grateful for everything you have done,+ they added.  As confirmed cases of Covid-19 exceed 200,000 around the world, hospitals have braced themselves for the surge.  Hospitals in Singapore have also been preparing for a rise in the number of cases, with Singapore seeing more imported cases in recent days.  Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said on Wednesday that the aim is to reduce the total number of cases on any day, so that the healthcare system can cope with the load.

Here is what families should do when picking up anyone returning home, according to two infectious diseases experts.  PREPARATIONS  Dr Piotr Chlebicki, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Alvernia Hospital, said his daughter would be flying back on Friday from Sydney, where she is a student at the University of New South Wales.  He said it is important for parents to speak with their children before they board their flights to make sure they are asymptomatic.  +If they have symptoms like cough, fever or sore throat, they should not be flying. They should be considerate to other passengers,+ said Dr Chlebicki.  Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam said that people can be asymptomatic for two weeks, so anyone returning from abroad should be isolated for that duration.  Families must prepare a separate room, ideally with an attached bathroom, for the person, he said.  It would also be helpful to cordon off the area outside the person+s room, or any shared toilet, with tape, so that it would be a visual reminder, he added.  PICK-UP AT THE AIRPORT  Dr Leong, who practises at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said the person arriving should wear a mask and sit alone in the back seat of the car or taxi.  Windows should be down, and the air-conditioning in the vehicle switched off, he said.  The person should avoid any direct contact like hugging or kissing, and handle his own luggage.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  ARRIVAL AT HOME  Dr Leong said the person must go straight to his room once he reaches his home, and avoid touching any surfaces such as doorknobs or handles.  He should wipe down his luggage in his own room, either with water or disinfectant, he added.  +Clothes should be soaked in a pail of water for at least five to 10 minutes before being placed in a washing machine.+  INTERACTING WITH FAMILY  Dr Leong said: +The general rule is that he should keep a physical distance of more than 2m apart at all times.  +A family member needs to prepare food and water and place it outside his room, and he can come out and bring it into his room.+  However, Dr Chlebicki said that if the person is asymptomatic, the risk of getting infected by them is low, so there may not be a need for total separation.  The person can come out to get a drink of water, for example.  Related Story Coronavirus: How to quarantine yourself  +If they cough, they could generate a droplet (that could infect others). So, it is possible to be contagious before you display symptoms.  +But asymptomatic people are inefficient in transmitting the virus because they have a smaller amount of it, compared to symptomatic people. I think there should be a risk-benefit balance - the risk of getting the virus from an asymptomatic person is low and the benefit of having your child at home is high.+  But the person should still spend the bulk of the time in a separate room, he said, and family members should also observe basic hygiene such as frequent hand-washing.  Dr Leong said that if the person is using a shared bathroom, more precautions should be taken because the virus can be transmitted via surfaces. +He must wipe down what he touches before and after use, and close the (toilet) lid when flushing. The family members must also do the same.+  Similarly, all +high-touch+ areas in the home, such as door handles, doorknobs, taps and sinks must be cleaned frequently, he added.

According to the Ministry of Health+s website, people who have recently travelled overseas, and are feeling unwell with a fever or respiratory symptoms like a cough or runny nose, should go to any of the Public Health Preparedness Clinics, or polyclinics to seek medical attention promptly.  +The risk of picking up Covid-19 for people who have travelled is really much higher than the general population,+ he added.","117":"SINGAPORE - Singapore has managed to ramp up its import of eggs from other countries following Malaysia+s lockdown on Wednesday (March 18), Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Thursday.  About 73 per cent of Singapore+s eggs are from Malaysia, according to last published official figures from 2018, and Malaysia+s latest Covid-19 movement restriction order has left some worried about Singapore+s egg supply.  But Mr Chan reiterated on Facebook that +we also have many other source countries which we have identified over the years and are able activate them quickly when the need calls for it+.  +This applies not just to eggs but other food products and essential items... These efforts to secure and diversify our food supply have been developed and strengthened through the years,+ he said.  The minister was at Changi Airport on Thursday to receive \u201cvery special cargo\u201d - 300,000 eggs from Thailand.  Singapore also imports eggs from accredited farms in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. About a quarter of all eggs Singaporeans consume daily are produced locally.  The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said on Wednesday that Singapore+s food supply has not been disrupted by Malaysia+s two-week lockdown.

Opening up to The Straits Times about his journey home, the 19-year-old Malaysian whose family is based in Singapore described the +nightmarish+ scenario at the airport as he waited to board his flight, with travellers around him garbed in hazmat suits and raincoats.  +None of us wanted to (leave) because we did not see the point or felt that the coronavirus was quite far away from Britain then and would not reach it... (This) was a misconception,+ he said.  Britain reported its first confirmed case of the virus in January, although these were initially imported cases from China. As local clusters began to emerge later, Mr Soh said he grew alarmed as he saw first-hand the panic buying which had up till then been just an Asian phenomenon.  He said: +Towards the third week of February, supermarkets started running out of poultry and eggs and I had to survive on pasta for at least a week before different items started getting replenished. Panic buying is happening in (Britain), not just in Asia.+  He then decided to return home following a debate with his parents, who urged him to return home as soon as possible. +I would have (had) no one to turn to and no one to take care of me if I were to fall sick... When I tried to get hand sanitisers and face masks, the prices were also extortionate,+ he said.  Mr Soh said he had to queue for almost three hours at Heathrow because there was only one counter for at least three different airlines. He estimates that there were over 1,000 people in the queue.  +Sometimes, you really cannot believe some things on social media until you see it for yourself... The poor knowledge of (how to put on masks) also led some travellers to contaminate their masks, defeating the purpose of putting on masks in the first place,+ he said.  He is self-isolating for two weeks despite having arrived before the stay-home notice for travellers from Britain kicked in.  He urged students who are still overseas to +make a decision fast+, saying that the unpredictability of governments+ responses to the evolving Covid-19 situation could lead to border controls that may impede future travel.  The fluid global situation during the Covid-19 pandemic has led Singaporean students studying abroad to book flights home en masse.

The university has since assured the society that the necessary processes will be put in place to ensure no student is disadvantaged academically. It has also sent out an e-mail saying that those who choose not to return home to their home countries +are welcome to do so and we will support you staying in Oxford+.  The Singapore Society of Imperial College London has also created a live news link that provides updates to its members of the Covid-19 situation, including a section of which airlines are still operating between Britain and Singapore.

Among them, 33 were imported and 30 involved Singapore residents returning from abroad. This brought the total number of cases here to 313.  In light of these recent developments, it is vital that people mind their health, and take the necessary precautions should they feel unwell.  Q: What are the symptoms for Covid-19?  The two most common symptoms for Covid-19 are fever (of 37.8 deg C and above) and cough.  Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam said that those who are experiencing either of the two symptoms, or both, should consult a doctor.  He also added that those who feel generally unwell should also see a doctor, noting that practically all the identified Covid-19 cases had the sensation of being unwell at some point.  Q: What about mild, flu-like symptoms which are not fever and cough? Should I visit the doctor as well?  Other mild, flu-like symptoms such as sore throat, stuffy nose and runny nose should be monitored closely for at least five days, said Dr Leong, as sore throat and stuffy nose were not symptoms present in 90 per cent of the confirmed Covid-19 cases.  However, people should look out for any prolonged or worsening symptoms, as well as new, developing symptoms, he noted, and see a doctor if these occur.  In the meantime, individuals should practise self-quarantine measures at home and avoid going out, as there is a chance they could be incubating the virus.  Q: Can I self-medicate at home if I+m facing any of the above symptoms?  You may self-medicate if you are facing mild symptoms. However, you should visit a doctor if the symptoms are prolonged or worsening.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  If you are having a cough or fever, which are common Covid-19 symptoms, you should definitely visit a doctor.  On whether people suffering from Covid-19 symptoms should avoid taking ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug meant for fever and pain, Dr Leong said that it has not yet been clinically proven that the drug predisposes the body to more infections.  But he suggests they choose alternatives such as paracetamol, synflex or voltaren as a precautionary measure.  Q: Should I visit the doctor if I+m experiencing breathlessness?  Yes, although breathlessness does not usually develop until the later stages of Covid-19. By then, individuals would have experienced other accompanying symptoms as well, noted Dr Leong.  Dr Piotr Chlebicki, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Alvernia Hospital, also shared the same advice, adding that breathlessness is cause for medical attention, as the individual could be facing other complications like heart disease or asthma.  Q: What if I am asymptomatic so far, but I don+t feel very well in general, should I still see the doctor?  Yes, as long as you are feeling unwell, or sense that something is out of the ordinary, it would be a good idea to visit the doctor.  Dr Chlebicki also suggested that it would be good practice to call in to clinics before going, as this could help reduce overcrowding.  In addition, you should also refrain from doctor-hopping, said MOH in an advisory on March 11, as going back to the same doctor could ensure follow-up, and that you+re sent for Covid-19 testing if necessary.","120":"SINGAPORE - The Republic has confirmed 32 new coronavirus patients, including 24 imported cases, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Thursday (March 19).  This is a drop from the 47 new cases that were recorded on Wednesday, the highest number since the start of the outbreak.  All of the imported cases were returning residents and long-term pass holders, with the bulk having travelled to Europe - currently the epicentre of the virus. Most patients who visited Europe were in Britain \u2013 13 patients \u2013 while the others had visited countries like Switzerland and France.  As for the other imported cases, they had visited other countries such as the United States and parts of Asia like Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines.  The remaining eight patients were locally transmitted cases, with two linked to previous cases including one from a sub-cluster linked to the Boulder+ Gym at 12 Kallang Avenue. Boulder+ Gym is a sub-cluster of a cluster linked to a private dinner event at Safra Jurong.  The other six local cases are not linked to previous cases.  With 32 new cases on Thursday, the total number of infected patients here now stands at 345. Of these, 159 are imported cases and the remaining 186 cases are locally transmitted cases.  This means close to one in two patients in Singapore are imported cases who got the coronavirus from overseas.  Seven more patients have been discharged from hospital, bringing the total number of patients who have fully recovered to 124.  Of the 221 patients still in hospital, 15 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.  As of Thursday 12pm, MOH said it has identified 6,574 close contacts who have been quarantined.  Of these, 2,273 are currently quarantined, and 4,301 have completed their quarantine.","121":"SINGAPORE - New developments for the Covid-19 situation have been coming thick and fast over the past few days, with Malaysia deciding to impose a lockdown and fresh travel restrictions being put in place by Singapore. Reporter Lester Wong explains what these developments mean for Singaporeans.  Q: What does the Malaysian lockdown involve?  A: Malaysia+s two-week lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus kicked in on Wednesday (March 18) and will run until March 31. During this period, Malaysian citizens are barred from travelling overseas and foreign visitors will not be allowed into the country.  Public gatherings are banned, along with all religious, sporting, social and cultural events. Schools, universities and non-essential businesses remain closed.  Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said on Monday that essential services such as food supply, banking, healthcare, transport and security will continue to operate.  Grocery stores, supermarkets and pharmacies have also stayed open.  Malaysia has shut its side of the Causeway and Second Link, although some exemptions have been made.  Q: Can Singaporeans residing in Malaysia come back to Singapore?  A: Yes. The Malaysian lockdown only applies to Malaysian citizens. However, those who return to Singapore after 11.59pm on Friday will have to serve 14 days of self-isolation.  Q: Are there any exemptions that can continue to travel between Singapore and Malaysia?  A: Yes. Delivery workers on the many trucks making trips across the Causeway with supplies of fresh food, pharmaceuticals and infant diapers are allowed through the checkpoints.  +You can+t expect them to drive through and then tell them to stay at home for 14 days,+ National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said on Wednesday, referring to the delivery drivers.

A district court heard that the man even lied to the minor, claiming that he reciprocated her feelings even though he felt no romantic attachment to her.  Deputy Public Prosecutor Ho Jiayun said: +Ultimately, he took advantage of her youthful affection for him... and saw her merely as a means to satisfy his own sexual desire.+  On Thursday (March 19), the 33-year-old man was sentenced to three years and seven months+ jail after pleading guilty to two counts of sexually penetrating a minor.  He also admitted to one count of sexually exploiting a child. Four other similar charges involving the same girl were considered during sentencing.  Due to a gag order, details of the offender and the school cannot be revealed to protect the victim+s identity.  The court heard that he had been one of the girl+s teachers since she was a Secondary 1 student in 2017.

A check on the phone also uncovered messages suggesting a romantic relationship between the pair.  The father alerted the school principal, who lodged a police report two days later.  Urging the court to sentence the offender to more than four years+ jail, DPP Ho told District Judge Christopher Goh that the girl had trusted the teacher to nurture and educate her.  The DPP added: +He abused this trust by sexually exploiting the victim and leading her down the path of moral corruption.+  For each count of sexually penetrating a minor, the man could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined.  The Ministry of Education (MOE) said in response to queries by The Straits Times that it was unable to take internal disciplinary action against the man as police investigations were ongoing at the time of the case and he had also resigned from the teaching service in April last year before he was charged with any offences.  MOE added that teachers must always conduct themselves in a manner which upholds the integrity of the profession and the trust placed in them.  MOE will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against those who fail to adhere to its standards of conduct and discipline, including dismissal from service.

In a post on the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) Facebook page on Thursday (March 19), Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir said that Muslims here should +play (their) part+ and not attend such gatherings, which have caused widespread infection of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  +I hear that some foreign religious organisers say that they fear God more than viruses and therefore, they continue with gatherings,+ said Dr Nazirudin.  +This is not the time to be senseless and irresponsible. I would like to be absolutely clear.+  From Feb 27 to March 1, more than 16,000 devotees had gathered at the Masjid Jamek Sri Petaling in Kuala Lumpur.  This gathering, believed to be for followers of the Tablighi Jama+at, a Muslim missionary movement, has since turned into a large cluster after hundreds of its attendees were infected with the Covid-19 virus.  At least five Singaporeans who returned here from this gathering have tested positive for Covid-19.  So far, 101 Singaporeans have been identified as having attended the gathering in Malaysia.  Mosques islandwide are currently closed for two weeks to prevent the coronavirus from spreading any further in religious institutions here.

But despite being warned not to cheat, a significant number allegedly shared their answers and plagiarised one another.  NUS is now scrutinising their submissions and identifying the alleged cheaters so action can be taken against them.  Replying to queries from The New Paper, a spokesman for the NUS School of Computing confirmed it is investigating, with instructors still making plagiarism checks and have yet to finalise the results.  +NUS takes a serious view of academic dishonesty and does not condone plagiarism,+ she said.  TNP understands Mr Prabawa Adi Yoga Sidi, the lecturer teaching the module, sent out an e-mail about a week ago urging students who had cheated to confess.  It is believed that several have come forward and admitted to plagiarism.  The exam is worth 15 per cent of the final grade for the programming methodology module, which is compulsory for engineering students.  The module, also known as CS1010E, is described as an introduction to fundamental concepts of problem solving, involving the use of computing and programming in the Python programming language.  The spokesman said about 680 students are taking the module in the current semester.  CLASS SETTING  The exam is usually held in a class setting, but in light of Covid-19, Mr Prabawa allowed it to be taken at home earlier this month.  Related Story NUS reminds students to declare travel plans after foreign exchange student expelled  Students had to log in at the same time to work independently on three tasks, comprising seven questions, and submit their answers online.

According to NUS policies, students who plagiarise or aid and abet such actions may be subject to disciplinary action.  +In addition, the student may receive a reduced grade, possibly even a zero mark, for the relevant academic assignment, project or thesis, and could receive a failed grade for the module,+ said the spokesman.  +Any student caught plagiarising will be required to retain the plagiarised module as graded.+  Numerous posts on Facebook page NUSWhispers in the past week claimed to be from students taking the module.  Some claimed they had cheated because the conditions were difficult and it was to be expected, while others said they had learnt their lesson.  One post, addressed to Mr Prabawa, claimed that if disciplinary action was taken, it would be the school+s fault that +almost half+ of the students would be severely affected and face problems with graduation and finding jobs.

This downgraded forecast still comes with significant downside risks should the coronavirus outbreak worsen further, DBS economist Irvin Seah said in a research note on Thursday (March 19).  He also expects total retrenchments for the year to reach about 24,500, slightly above the 23,430 in 2009 during the Global Financial Crisis.  +Considering the chaotic situation in many parts of the world and the economic costs of those restrictive measures on trade, investment, consumption and travel, this is evolving into a +self-induced+ global recession. Being a small and open economy, Singapore will not be spared,+ he said.  Mr Seah said a second stimulus package of up to $14 billion to $16 billion could be rolled out, funded by the remaining Budget surplus for this term of Government of about $7.7 billion and an additional $6 billion to $8 billion from the reserves.  A $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package was announced during the Budget statement last month.  He also expects the Monetary Authority of Singapore to take a more aggressive monetary response amid falling inflation and the significant downside risk to growth.  +Specifically, we expect MAS to end the modest and gradual appreciation path of the SGD NEER (nominal effective exchange rate) policy band, and introduce a downward re-centring of the band by up to 2 per cent. In fact, an announcement before the next scheduled policy meeting around mid-April should not come as a surprise, given the urgency of the matter,+ he said.  Mr Seah said he expects year-on-year contractions of up to 2 percentage points for the first two quarters of the year - which would be a technical recession - and a contraction in the third quarter before an improvement at the end of the year.  He noted that this comes after the bank revised Singapore+s gross domestic product growth forecast down to 0.9 per cent on Feb 7. But back then, the Covid-19 outbreak was still largely contained within China, with only pockets of infection elsewhere.  The situation has deteriorated sharply since then, with the number of infections in other parts of the world multiplying by more than 400 times, he said.  Also, travel restrictions imposed by Singapore have been broadened beyond China to cover markets accounting for about 69 per cent of Singapore+s total tourist arrivals last year, he said.  These include South Korea, Britain, Japan, France and Asean countries.  Related Story Deeper wage offsets, foreign worker levy waivers on wish list  Related Story MAS says it stands ready to ensure the stability of Singapore+s financial system amid coronavirus spread  As such, the services sector - particular tourism-related industries such as hotels and restaurants, aviation, point-to-point transport services, retail and entertainments services will be severely impacted.  A sharp contraction in global demand would also put a dent on the near-term prospects for Singapore+s exports and the manufacturing sector, said Mr Seah, adding that global economic activity will slow significantly, as governments around the world have introduced city- and country-wide lockdowns and border closures, and companies have put in place business continuity plans.  He said that Singapore+s downturn this year will be a lot deeper than that during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, and more painful than the Global Financial Crisis in 2009.  In these two downturns, Singapore still managed to post GDP growth of 4.5 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively, he said.  He noted that the previous occasions when Singapore saw full year contractions were during the Dot.com Bust in 2001 (-1.1 per cent), the Asian Financial Crisis in 1999 (-2.2 per cent) and the manufacturing recession in 1985 (-0.6 per cent).  For the second government support package, Mr Seah proposed the following measures:  \u2022 Broaden the temporary bridging loan scheme to include all industries;  \u2022 Increase the quantum of the temporary bridging loan scheme to up to $2 million, up from $1 million;  \u2022 Increase the quantum of the working capital loan scheme to up to $1 million, up from $600,000;  \u2022 Raise wage subsidy under the Jobs Support Scheme to 12 per cent for all Singaporean workers, up from 8 per cent, with the grant covering six months instead of three;  \u2022 Disburse a one-off cash grant to micro and small enterprises immediately; and,  \u2022 Waive for one month the foreign worker levy for workers affected by measures introduced to counter the spread of Covid-19.  He also hopes to see more help for workers at risk of losing their jobs, such as deferment of personal income tax payments for all retrenched workers, a one-off retrenchment benefit for those displaced, and tax deductions for profitable companies to hire retrenched workers.  Other economists are still expecting the economy to grow over the year, for now.  OCBC Bank chief economist Selena Ling said the bank\u2019s latest forecast for Singapore\u2019s full year GDP growth is 0.3 per cent.  She added that this will be reassessed based on GDP growth data for the first quarter of this year, which will be released next month, the upcoming second fiscal stimulus package, MAS\u2019 expected monetary policy easing, and whether Malaysia will extend its Movement Control Order beyond March 31.  United Overseas Bank\u2019s growth forecast for this year is 0.5 per cent, though there are further downside risks, said the bank\u2019s economist Barnabas Gan.  He said that the estimates also assume a potential technical recession in the first half of the year.  \u201cAccounting for the direct negative effects on Singapore\u2019s tourism industry as well as secondary effects on Asia\u2019s supply chain and external environment, we perceive Singapore\u2019s output gap to stay negative for the whole of 2020,\u201d he said, meaning that the Republic\u2019s economy is expected to perform below its potential.","127":"SINGAPORE - St Andrew+s Cathedral, the oldest Anglican site of worship in Singapore, has been closed after one of its members was infected with the coronavirus.

This is due to the +Tighter Measures to Minimise Further Spread of Covid-19+ advisory that was released by the Ministry of Health on Tuesday.  Since last Saturday, Singapore Pools has had social distancing measures in place. It had reduced operating hours, closed off selected centres, regulated access and placed physical separation measures at queues.  Starting on Wednesday, it has ensured that all live lottery draws such as 4D, Toto and Singapore Sweep are held behind closed doors, and suspended the screening of live draws at branches.  While the public can no longer attend the draws, account holders can still place their bets online or via telephone.

In a statement on Wednesday (March 25), the Manpower Ministry (MOM) said it would step up inspections on the ground to disperse large gatherings by foreign workers, in particular foreign domestic workers (FDWs).  +As outdoor gatherings among FDWs tend to be large, MOM will take action to disperse them as an added precaution... Workers who do not cooperate will have their work passes revoked,+ said the statement.  The MOM singled out places frequented by migrant workers, including City Plaza in Paya Lebar, where Indonesian maids, among others, are seen, and Lucky Plaza in Orchard Road, a popular gathering place for Filipino domestic workers on their days off.  It also highlighted Little India, where workers from the South Asian community frequent, and Peninsula Plaza in North Bridge Road, also known as +Little Burma+ for its patronage by the Myanmar community.  There are about 255,800 FDWs and 284,300 foreign construction workers here as of June last year. Together, they account for almost 10 per cent of Singapore+s population.  The MOM said the steps were taken in view of tighter measures at the national level.  From 11.59pm on Thursday, all entertainment venues such as bars and cinemas will have to close, and gatherings outside work and school cannot exceed 10 people.  Malls can stay open but only if they ensure crowd density is reduced.  On Wednesday, the MOM advised foreign workers to remain in their residence on rest days, and said their employers and dormitory operators should +educate+ them on this.  Workers should minimise time spent outside when running important errands, while employers should know where they are and have them return home once their tasks are complete.  Workers should also observe good personal hygiene and minimise physical contact by not shaking hands or sharing food, and maintaining a safe distance from one another.  If they meet indoors, workers must observe the latest rules on gatherings, the MOM added.  +Collective social responsibility is critical in slowing the transmission of Covid-19. We ask for the cooperation of workers to take necessary precautions and exercise individual responsibility,+ said the ministry.","130":"SINGAPORE - In Parliament on Wednesday (March 25), Health Minister Gan Kim Yong gave an update on the Republic+s strategy in fighting the coronavirus since the outbreak here in January.  As of Wednesday, Singapore has seen 558 cases, of which two patients have died. Of the total, 155 have recovered.  The crux of Singapore+s strategy is to slow down the infection rate and maintain it at as low a level for as long as possible, Mr Gan said.  This will help the country to better conduct epidemiological investigations, contact tracing and quarantining of close contacts, to prevent further spread and to preserve healthcare capacity to care for the more severe cases.  These were the key points in his ministerial statement.  3 waves of cases  Singapore has seen three waves of cases so far.  Late-January to February: Imported cases from China. The virus originated in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province. These early patients were mostly tourists from Wuhan to Singapore.  February to March: Some of these imported cases led to local clusters, such as one at a health products store frequented by Chinese tourists, and another cluster comprising two churches. Two Chinese visitors had visited one of the churches, leading to Singaporeans being infected.  Mid-March to present: Second wave of imported cases. This has seen numbers doubling in a week from 266 to 558 as of Tuesday, and almost 80 per cent of these were imported. The patients are not from China, even though about 1,000 Singapore permanent residents and long-term pass holders have returned from China in the past week.  Instead, the new cases are Singaporeans and residents returning from three key countries: Britain, the United States and Indonesia.  The big worry now: +Over the coming weeks, the number of cases will continue to rise, as some of our around 200,000 overseas Singaporeans return home from all over the world,+ said Mr Gan.  Singapore+s 3-pronged strategy to fight Covid-19  1. Reduce importation of cases  Border controls have been imposed since January to stem the inflow of travellers to the country.  First, recent visitors to Hubei were barred entry. Now, all short-term visitors from anywhere in the world are barred entry and transit.  Only Singaporeans, PRs and long-term work pass holders can return from abroad.  Residents are also urged not to travel and will face penalties - such as unsubsidised Covid-19 care - should they do.  2. Detect and isolate cases early  Since news of the virus emerged, border checks have been strengthened to detect and isolate cases before they come into contact with the rest of Singapore.  For example, temperature screening, health checks and swabbing have been progressively implemented at all checkpoints.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Related Story Interactive: How coronavirus is spreading across the world  Suspected cases are conveyed directly to hospitals, and symptomatic travellers and some selected travellers are swabbed as a precautionary measure.  Beyond checkpoints, there is a surveillance system in place at hospitals, polyclinics and the more than 900 clinics under the Public Health Preparedness scheme.  These clinics offer attractive subsidised rates for patients with respiratory illnesses to seek treatment and be spotted early if they have Covid-19.  There have been more than 267,000 subsidised attendances at these clinics so far, on top of patients checked at polyclinics, said Mr Gan.  To date, Singapore has done around 39,000 Covid-19 tests. This translates to 6,800 tests per million people in Singapore. It compares with about 6,500 in South Korea and 1,000 in Taiwan.  Said Mr Gan: +These tests are important in helping us to detect as many cases as possible and as early as possible.+  Contact tracing is also a crucial weapon.  The moment a case is confirmed, contact tracing is activated to identify close contacts and to quarantine them as soon as possible, so as to reduce further spread of the disease.  Singapore has ramped up contact tracing efforts, from three teams when the process started to 20 teams. Officers are from the Health Ministry, Singapore Police Force and, now, also agencies like the Singapore Armed Forces.  The teams can trace up to 4,000 contacts each day, and will continue to scale up as needed. Technology is also being used, such as the TraceTogether app launched by the Health Ministry and GovTech last week.  3. Emphasis on social responsibility and good personal hygiene  The Government has stressed how individuals must play their part to reduce the risk of transmission. They can do this through good personal hygiene, social responsibility, and safe distancing.  Related Story Keeping clean the first line of defence against coronavirus: Expert panel  It has urged people to abide by quarantine orders and stay-home notices.  +If you violate them, there will be penalties, and the greatest penalty is that you may infect others close to you,+ the minister said.  Messages on things like the need to wash your hands and to see a doctor immediately have been widely circulated.  The Government has also extended help to employers whose employees have to serve out quarantine and stay-home notices.  The Health Ministry has paid particular attention to seniors, urging them to stay safe and to avoid activities in large groups.  Research efforts  Scientists in Singapore have been developing research and knowledge on Covid-19 and sharing these with other countries, said Mr Gan.  In the area of treatment, a therapeutic work group comprising members from various hospitals across different disciplines and the Health Sciences Authority has been set up.  It is working on guidelines for repurposed drugs with antiviral activity - such as Lopinavir-ritonavir, Interferon Beta-1B and hydroxychloroquine - to treat infected patients in Singapore.  The National Centre for Infectious Disease and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, together with the Singapore Blood Blank, have started to collect convalescent blood plasma from recovered patients for treatment for other patients.

On vaccines, scientists around the world have successfully isolated and cultured the virus, which will help develop a vaccine, said Mr Gan.  Global work is also being done to identify vaccine candidates and conduct testing, such as how Moderna Inc has started human trials.  Singapore+s Duke-NUS Medical School is working with Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and international partners to develop a clinical trial for a vaccine. There are plans to start testing this year.  Mr Gan said that with all these ongoing efforts, WHO estimates that the earliest a vaccine will be ready would likely be sometime next year.  +We do not know how long the pandemic will last, but we have to plan on the basis that Covid-19 will be with us for a long while, maybe till the end of the year or longer, and ensure that we have the resources and capabilities to see us through.+  Managing healthcare capacity  The Government has said it will ensure sufficient capacity to meet not just the needs of Covid-19 patients but also that of other patients.  Investments had already been made to manage infectious outbreaks in Singapore, with the 330-bed National Centre for Infections Diseases (NCID) built for just this purpose, and with spare capacity, said Mr Gan.  Related Story Coronavirus: 49 patients moved to private hospitals to free up capacity at public facilities  The NCID can be further increased to over 500 beds if needed, he added.  To fight the coronavirus, public hospitals had earlier reviewed their patients and deferred non-urgent and elective procedures, while also ensuring these patients get enough supportive care.  The ministry is also collaborating with private hospitals for some non-Covid-19 patients to be cared for there instead.  Also, because about 80 per cent of Covid-19 cases have been found to be mild to moderate, the MOH is tapping private hospitals and setting up community care facilities for such patients. Patients here will continue to be quarantined and closely monitored so there is no community risk. Only when they have fully recovered and tested negative for the virus twice over 24 hours will they be discharged.  These steps will allow critical hospital resources to be focused on the seriously ill and minimise deaths.  Mr Gan also noted how healthcare workers - +the most important resource+ - are taking on a very heavy load, and thanked them, and said measures have been put in place to reduce burnout. +Most importantly, every case we can avoid will help to lighten their load,+ he said.  +No sharp peak or long tail+  Just as it+s important to ensure sufficient healthcare capacity, it is equally important to prevent new local clusters in the first place, he stressed.  Related Story Coronavirus: How flattening the epidemic curve will buy time and keep outbreak in check  Related Story Steps countries are taking to buy time to help fight the virus  Related Story Coronavirus: How South Korea flattened the curve  This way, Singapore can try to avoid an exponential growth in the number of infections, which could quickly overwhelm the healthcare system, as seen in Hubei and Italy, and increasingly in many other countries.  Singapore+s strategy is to slow down the infection rate and maintain it at as low a level for as long as possible, Mr Gan told Parliament.  A lower infection rate will help the country to better conduct epidemiological investigations, contact tracing and quarantining of close contacts, to prevent further spread in the community, he said.  It also preserves healthcare capacity to care for the more severe cases.  He noted that if nothing is done, the number of cases will shoot up, as seen in some countries.  In such a scenario, the only hope is that most of the population gets infected and becomes immune, and the rate of infection starts to slow down as more become immune, or a vaccine or a cure is found.  +This scenario may seem attractive - you get over with it very quickly - but there are unfortunately two major risks,+ Mr Gan said.  First, an uncontrolled spike in the number of cases in a short period of time will overwhelm the healthcare system, easily resulting in high mortality rates, +and there is no turning back once we are on this track+.  The second risk is that it is not certain yet that this immunity will be effective or sustained.  One alternative is to introduce stringent safe distancing and other measures to slow down the infection rate.  +The number will still grow, but if we do it right, we will end up with a lower peak,+ he said.  This is commonly known as flattening the curve.  +But by flattening the curve, we may actually stretch out the pandemic, meaning it will take longer for the pandemic to be over,+ he said.  +For Singapore, we are still at the start of the curve today, and we have a chance, to do neither,+ he said.  +We hope that if we do it right, we can significantly slow down the growth as much as we can, until the pandemic is over, without either a sharp peak or long tail,+ he said.  +This may sound impossible, because these are the two curves that are established by academics. But as impossible as it may sound, we have to try our best to do so.+  LISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST","131":"SINGAPORE - Singapore confirmed 73 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday (March 25) - the largest increase in a day, which brought the total number of cases here to 631, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said.  Two new clusters have formed - the first has 18 cases linked to a new cluster at the PCF Sparkletots pre-school at Fengshan Block 126. Of these, 14 cases are staff at the pre-school, while four are family members of case 601 - a 47-year-old Singaporean woman.  The second new cluster comprises three staff members at Dover Court International School.  In a statement, an Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) spokesman said PCF will close all of its centres for four days from Thursday to Sunday, to review its precautionary measures and clean and disinfect all its premises.  The spokesman said another 13 staff members from the Fengshan pre-school - a mix of teaching and non-teaching staff - tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, following the Nursery 2 teacher who was found to have the coronavirus on Monday.  One of them is the centre principal, who was well when she was at work on March 17, but developed symptoms in the afternoon, the spokesman said.  On that day, she had a meeting with her staff, and later attended a course with other pre-school staff in the evening. The principal saw a doctor the next morning, on March 18, and was on medical leave until last Friday.  Most of the other staff who tested positive began developing symptoms from last Friday and over the weekend, the spokesman said.  Of the 73 new cases, 38 were imported. All except one of the imported cases were returning residents and long-term pass holders who had travelled to Europe, North America, Asean and other parts of Asia.  The remaining 35 new cases were locally transmitted. Of these, 27 cases were linked to clusters or previous cases, while contact tracing is ongoing for eight cases that are not linked to travel or previous cases, the MOH said.  Five more cases were discharged from hospital. To date, 160 patients fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged.  Among the 404 patients still in hospital, a total of 17 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.  +Sixty-five cases who are clinically well but still test positive for Covid-19 have been transferred to Concord International Hospital, Mount Elizabeth Hospital and the Community Isolation Facility at D\u2019Resort NTUC for isolation and care,+ the ministry said.  As of noon on Wednesday, the MOH had identified 8,930 close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 2,643 are currently quarantined while 6,287 have completed their quarantine.  Related Story Coronavirus: ECDA orders Fengshan PCF Sparkletots centre to close for 2 weeks after teacher tests positive  Health Minister Gan Kim Yong on Wednesday told the House that the number of coronavirus cases will continue to rise in coming weeks as some of the 200,000 overseas Singaporeans return home.  He noted that the number of cases in Singapore had more than doubled last week.  Singapore announced its strictest measures to date in the fight against Covid-19 a day earlier, which included closing all entertainment outlets, limiting gatherings outside work and school to 10 people or fewer, and suspending all centre-based tuition and enrichment classes.  To deter people from travelling overseas, any Singapore resident or long-term pass holder who leaves Singapore from Friday will be charged unsubsidised rates should they be hospitalised in public hospitals for Covid-19 treatment.  They will also not be able to claim from MediShield Life or Integrated Shield Plans for these treatments at public and private hospitals.  The tough measures will take effect on 11.59pm on Thursday and will be in place until the end of April, at least.  To assist businesses and Singaporeans in coping with the economic impact of the outbreak, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat will present a supplementary Budget in Parliament on Thursday. It will detail additional support measures for workers, businesses and households.  The coronavirus has so far infected more than 436,000 people worldwide and killed over 19,600.","132":"SINGAPORE - All travellers arriving in Singapore will receive notices of their stay-home requirements electronically from Friday (March 27) at 9am.  They will also be warned in advance of the penalties for failing to follow them, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said on Wednesday.  The travellers - including Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders - will receive their 14-day stay-home notices by e-mail after they have submitted their health declarations, as required by law, via the SG Arrival Card e-Service which will be available online before Friday.  The service will allow travellers to complete forms before their arrival and be notified of their 14-day isolation earlier, instead of only during immigration clearance, the ICA said.  On Monday, the ICA announced that all travellers arriving in Singapore must submit health declarations online before proceeding with immigration clearance. This is an additional precautionary measure to reduce imported Covid-19 cases.  Data provided may be used for contact tracing purposes and will become part of the traveller+s medical history for reference at local healthcare institutions where travellers could be treated for Covid-19.  In its statement, the ICA reminded travellers to provide valid e-mail addresses and contact numbers when submitting the electronic health declaration, as the acknowledgement of the receipt of the declaration and the stay-home notice will be sent to the e-mail addresses provided.  To avoid delays during immigration clearance, travellers will need to show the acknowledgement e-mail either on their mobile devices or as a printout copy.  All short-term visitors have already been barred from entry or transit through Singapore, so the latest measure is likely to affect only Singaporeans and residents, as well as those with long-term work passes and their dependants.  The authorities have repeatedly warned that failure to abide by rules put in place to contain the coronavirus outbreak can be punished under the Infectious Diseases Act.  Those found guilty of breaching the stay-home notice can be fined up to $10,000, jailed up to six months, or both. The pass holders may have their passes revoked or the validity shortened, while students attending educational institutions in Singapore may be disciplined, and could be suspended or dismissed.","133":"The music was pumping and the lights were flashing in bars, pubs and nightclubs at Clarke Quay. But one thing was missing - the crowd.  Yesterday was the last full night for patrons to party before nightclubs, pubs and bars shutter for more than a month at 11.59pm tonight, as part of the latest measures announced to stem the further spread of the coronavirus here.  But crowds were sparse at the various entertainment outlets located at Clarke Quay when The Straits Times visited last night. A handful of patrons were out and about for what some said was their last +hurrah+ at their favourite watering holes.  Cyber security manager Joe Hani A, 49, who was at a bar along the Singapore River, said he would miss hanging out at Le Noir, which he has visited at least once a week for the last decade.  +Disappointment would be too weak a word to describe how I feel,+ said Mr Joe of the news that entertainment outlets would have to close until the end of next month.  +I will have to make do with weekly gatherings with friends at my place instead until the bars re-open,+ he said, adding that he will make sure to keep the group to 10 people or fewer.  Even at popular nightclubs like Zouk, patrons did not have to wait long to enter and queues formed only as club-goers complied with measures such as temperature-taking and filling up contact tracing forms before entering.  Over at Emerald Hill, crowds were equally sparse as the usually packed street was empty, save for a few patrons.  A 47-year-old finance executive from France, who gave his name only as Mr Didier, was at a bar with a friend. He said following the closures, he would have to drink at home or at restaurants instead.    Club-goers did not have to wait long to enter popular nightclubs like Zouk, while at Le Noir (above), a bar at Clarke Quay, only a handful of patrons were spotted. ST PHOTO: KEVIN LIM    +But I am not complaining because elsewhere in Europe or France, for instance, I hear from family or friends that they are having it much worse. So, it is a luxury to still be able to see one another and have drinks,+ he added.  As part of the extensive measures announced on Tuesday by the multi-ministry task force tackling the Covid-19 outbreak, entertainment outlets will have to stop operations from 11.59pm tonight until April 30. These include places like karaoke outlets, cinemas and theatres.  Related Story Coronavirus: Closures further dampen local entertainment scene  The task force also said that gatherings outside school and work will be limited to a maximum of 10 people as part of the latest wave of sweeping regulations after the number of cases in Singapore more than doubled in the past week, from 266 to a total of 631 currently.  Earlier yesterday, the Singapore Tourism Board, Enterprise Singapore and police reminded entertainment outlets that they had to continue implementing safe distancing measures announced on March 20 if they intended to hold farewell events. These include having no more than 250 participants, a distance of at least a metre between all participants and reduced mingling.  But even without such social distancing measures, some live bands at Clarke Quay played to empty bars, while others saw just one or two tables filled with patrons.  Some nightclubs, such as Cherry Discotheque and Canvas Club Singapore, which had earlier said they would be holding special promotions and farewell events yesterday, also called them off on the same day.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Said engineer Albert Johnson, 35, who was at Clarke Quay to have a drink +before the real farewell+: +It is a pity that the businesses all have to close. I felt that stopping community gathering was sufficient, so I think it is a bit of an over-exaggeration.+  Others like a 31-year-old port worker, who wanted to be known only as Za and was at Clarke Quay with friends, said he was going to drink until the bars closed as it would be the last night he would be able to do so for a while.  +While I do feel sad that the bars will close for a while, I think it is also good to comply with such measures. Hopefully, the Covid-19 situation will end,+ he said.","134":"SINGAPORE - All government columbaria will be closed on weekends and public holidays until April 26 while visitors should keep to groups of four or fewer during weekdays, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said on Wednesday (March 25).  The announcement by the agency, which oversees government columbaria here, came in anticipation of a surge in visitors during the peak period between March 21 and April 19 with the annual Qing Ming festival on April 4 fast approaching.  The NEA said that senior citizens and young children should stay away altogether and that visitors should avoid crowding around the prayer and joss paper burning areas or risk having these areas closed off.  Visitors could also be temporarily stopped from going into the columbaria buildings if the NEA decides there is a need for crowd control.  With the closures on weekends and public holidays, visitors should arrange trips during weekdays and avoid peak hours such as the mornings, the NEA said.  It will keep government-run columbaria in Choa Chu Kang, Mandai and Yishun open 24 hours on weekdays until April 24 to give visitors more flexibility in their arrangements during the Covid-19 outbreak.  Visits should be kept short and the 1m social-distancing rule applies, the NEA added.  It has also said that hand sanitisers will be available at lift lobbies, tables will be spaced out and contact surfaces will be wiped down more frequently to maintain good hygiene standards.  +Visitors to our facilities are reminded to keep themselves and others around them safe by observing good hygiene habits, such as binning their litter and keeping the shared spaces clean,+ it added.","135":"SINGAPORE - Self-employed persons will each receive $9,000 in cash to help tide them over the coronavirus pandemic, said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat in his Supplementary Budget speech in Parliament on Thursday (March 26).  Mr Heng said he would set aside $1.2 billion for the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme, which will disburse $1,000 a month for nine months to eligible self-employed persons.  +Over the last few weeks, I received feedback from the labour movement and many self-employed persons calling for stronger support for the self-employed, who have less income security and whose livelihoods may be worse affected during this period of economic uncertainty,+ he said.  +This group has been harder to reach, as they work in diverse industries, many occupations, with varying working arrangements. They include taxi and private-hire car drivers, real estate agents, media and art freelancers and sport coaches.+  Mr Heng added that he would also provide sustained support for the self-employed to train and upskill during the downtime amid the Covid-19 economic slowdown.  He will set aside an additional $48 million to extend the Self-Employed Person Training Support Scheme, which was first introduced earlier this month.  Under the initial scheme, Singaporean and permanent resident freelancers receive a training allowance of $7.50 an hour when they undergo eligible courses over the next three months.  Mr Heng said he would raise the hourly allowance to $10 with effect from May 1 and extend the scheme to December this year.  The enhanced allowance is on top of existing training subsidies which cover up to 90 per cent of fees, he said. Trainees will also be able to tap their SkillsFuture credit.  More details on the schemes will be forthcoming from the Ministry of Manpower soon.  +Looking ahead, we will see how we can better support self-employed persons in strengthening their financial security,+ said Mr Heng. +We will study this carefully.+  He added that lower-wage workers, including self-employed ones, will have their incomes further augmented under the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme.  During his Budget speech last month, he announced that Singaporeans on Workfare last year would receive a one-off special cash payment amounting to 20 per cent of their payout last year, with a minimum payout of $100.  He will be increasing this payout to $3,000 per recipient.  To qualify for Workfare, Singaporeans must be 35 and older and earn a gross monthly income of not more than $2,300, among other criteria.","136":"SINGAPORE - The Government is setting aside a further $48.4 billion to support businesses, workers and families as Singapore grapples with an unprecedented crisis posed by the coronavirus pandemic.  This comes in addition to the $6.4 billion in measures that it announced just over a month ago to cushion the fallout from the Covid-19 outbreak.  In all, Singapore is dedicating nearly $55 billion to combat the coronavirus - about 11 per cent of its GDP - Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Thursday (March 26) when he unveiled the Supplementary Budget.  Mr Heng told the House: +This is a landmark package, and a necessary response to a unique situation.+  The additional $48 billion amounts to nearly half of the Government+s $106 billion Budget for 2020.  It is also more than double the $20.5 billion Resilience Package announced in the 2009 Budget to tackle the global financial crisis.  Mr Heng said President Halimah Yacob has given her in-principle support to draw up to $17 billion from the country+s past reserves to fund part of this $48 billion +Resilience Budget+.  This is only the second time Singapore has drawn on its national reserves to fund special Budget measures. The first time was during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, when then President S R Nathan approved a draw of $4.9 billion to fund support measures.  Describing the coronavirus pandemic as an +unprecedented crisis of a highly complex nature+, Mr Heng said: +In economic terms alone, this will likely be the worst economic contraction since independence.+  +This extraordinary situation calls for extraordinary measures,+ he added.  The Resilience Budget, as Mr Heng calls it, focuses on three key areas, Mr Heng said. First, to save jobs, support workers, and protect livelihoods.  Second, to help businesses overcome immediate challenges.  And third, to strengthen economic and social resilience so the country can emerge intact and stronger.  Mr Heng also announced that all Cabinet ministers - including the Prime Minister - and political office-holders will take a three-month pay cut to stand in solidarity with Singaporeans. The President, Speaker of Parliament and Deputy Speakers will do the same, he added.  Political office-holders will take an additional two-month pay cut on top of the one-month pay cut announced at the Budget last month, in the light of the deteriorating situation caused by the coronavirus, he said.  The Deputy Prime Minister noted that the coronavirus outbreak has impacted broad swathes of Singapore+s economy, with the aviation and tourism sectors worst hit.  He said international visitor arrivals have nearly ground to a halt.  Consumer-facing sectors such as food services, retail trade and land transport have been significantly affected, he said.  As external demand falls and supply chains get disrupted, outward-oriented sectors such as manufacturing and wholesale trade have also been hit, he added.  Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister spoke after Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin delivered President Halimah Yacob+s message on her behalf in Parliament.  Mr Tan said the second support package to tackle Covid-19 is a substantial one that exceeds the current reserves accumulated in this term of government.  +Our reserves were built up over the years through prudent spending, and were set aside precisely to cater for rainy days. The situation we are heading into looks more like a thunderstorm and not just a drizzle.+  Advance GDP estimates released on Thursday morning show that Singapore+s economy shrank 2.2 per cent in the first quarter.  The Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its 2020 growth forecast to a range of minus 4.0 per cent to minus 1.0 per cent this year, from an earlier estimate of minus 0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent.  The last time Singapore registered a full-year contraction of its economy was in 2001, during the dot.com bust, when growth fell by 1 per cent.  Setting out the grim worldwide economic outlook, Mr Heng said the global economy is now facing both supply and demand shocks.  On the supply side, locked down workers are unable to work, and a disruption in any one country will have knock-on effects worldwide as global supply chains are highly integrated.  Demand has fallen as people stay home and stop spending, he noted.  The International Monetary Fund expects a recession that will at minimum rival the one during the 2008 global financial crisis, while financial markets are being roiled by the mounting uncertainties, he said.  As an open economy that is highly integrated with the global economy, Singapore will be deeply impacted by global financial shocks, he added.  Mr Heng recounted how there were 800 confirmed cases outside of China just five weeks ago, when he presented Budget 2020 on Feb 18.  The outbreak has escalated quickly since, and the World Health Organisation now estimates that there are more 410,000 cases across more than 190 countries.  On the medical front, many countries have implemented lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus so that their healthcare systems are not overwhelmed, he said.  +In Singapore, we are doing everything we can to keep you and your families safe,+ he said.  The country has stepped up its measures as the outbreak worsened worldwide, he noted.  However, the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to take at least a year to be resolved, and the economic repercussions will last even longer, Mr Heng said.  +The world is seeing successive waves of infection, and importation of infections. We must be prepared to take further, tougher measures.+  Covid-19, Mr Heng said, is a defining challenge for Singapore - one that will test its social cohesion and pyschological resilience.  +The Government will take all the social and economic measures we need to keep our people safe, keep our economy running, and prepare ourselves for the recovery.  +Now, more than ever, we need Singaporeans to be strong, and ride through these challenges together.+  He said he named this Supplementary Budget the +Resilience Budget+ to reflect the country+s determination to remain resilient in the face of these challenges.  +Come what may, no matter how daunting the challenge at hand, we will bounce back, stronger and more united than ever as we weather this storm together,+ he said.","137":"SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - Nightclubs hoping to host +last hurrah+ and +farewell+ parties on Wednesday (March 25) were hit by instant public backlash, not to mention stern disapproval from the authorities.  The proposals for such parties come in the wake of Tuesday+s announcement that all entertainment venues, including bars, nightclubs and discos, must be closed from 11.59pm on Thursday to help stem the spread of Covid-19.  Some establishments urged clubbers to come out for +one last bash+ before the closures.  Cherry Discotheque at Cecil Street posted details of such a party on social media, with a number to call for +sofa reservations and public backlash+.  Others, like Club Lux at Orchard Plaza, decided on a two-day event with special promotions and performances, inviting clubbers to drink with them at +the last supper+ before the shutdown.  It did not go down well, with netizens slamming the clubs, calling them irresponsible.  The Singapore Tourism Board, Enterprise Singapore and Singapore Police Force subsequently issued a joint statement on Wednesday saying it was aware of such parties and urged people to be responsible.  The statement also said officers would be on the ground to monitor the situation.  The New Paper understands the police will be carrying out licensing enforcement at establishments, and those in breach may lose their relevant licences.  Cherry Discotheque has since cancelled its event, saying there was a +lack of foresight+.  On Wednesday night, the crowds were quite sparse at popular nightclubs like Zouk and areas like Clarke Quay.  Dr Jade Kua, a senior consultant at KK Women+s and Children+s Hospital, posted a video on Instagram on Wednesday urging clubbers to be responsible.  +To club operators who are hosting +last hurrah+ parties, and to the people who are going to them, please don+t,+ she said.  +We are in the middle of a pandemic, and it+s really bad.+  Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam told Parliament on Wednesday that the police would investigate reports of returning residents acting irresponsibly, flouting isolation orders and going to social gatherings and parties. He said offenders will be charged in court.  There are about 50,000 workers in the nightlife industry, and Mr Joseph Ong, the president of the Singapore Nightlife Business Association, told TNP that the multibillion-dollar industry is expected to be badly hit.  He said: +Singapore is not in a full lockdown like other countries, where only essential services are allowed to operate.  +But for some in the nightlife industry, because there is no way they can operate with the new measures, it is essentially the same thing.+  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Mr Ong, who is also the boss of 1-Group, which operates clubs such as Altimate and Yang, said the staff will have to be put on leave and that the rental costs were going to be a problem for many.  +I can only hope for some measures from the Government that will help us see some kind of light at the end of this tunnel.+","138":"SINGAPORE - The PAP Community Foundation (PCF) will review its operations, as another teacher at Fengshan PCF Sparkletots centre in Bedok North tested positive for the coronavirus.  This means that there are now 19 cases linked to Singapore+s newest Covid-19 cluster - 15 staff and four family members.  Five children who had said they felt unwell have tested negative for the virus, Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee told reporters on Thursday (March 26).  The Fengshan centre+s remaining 10 staff and about 110 students are now in quarantine. Another 30 staff from other PCF centres have also been placed under quarantine, as they had attended a training course with the Fengshan PCF centre+s principal.  The pre-school operator which runs 360 centres islandwide will +take a pause+ to revisit with all staff its standard-operating procedures and guidelines.  This will be done +to provide the reassurance to parents across the board that they will continue to provide and strengthen protocols in place for pre-schools+, Mr Lee said.  As of Thursday, 15 staff at the Fengshan centre were infected with Covid-19, including one teacher who tested positive on Thursday morning.  The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) said on Wednesday evening that all 360 PCF centres will close for four days from Thursday after the cases were found to be linked to the pre-school.  Said Mr Lee: +Some may perceive that in this particular case, some teachers who were not well ought to have left the centre immediately, rather than carry on with their duties for a couple more hours.  Related Story All PCF centres to close for 4 days after coronavirus cluster reported at Fengshan Sparkletots pre-school  Related Story Coronavirus: ECDA orders Fengshan PCF Sparkletots centre to close for 2 weeks after teacher tests positive  +But I hope that parents, public and other colleagues, recognise the realities on the ground, and not in a two dimensional way. Because I+m sure the teachers concerned, the operators, managers, in hindsight have seen facts and they will take the necessary measures hereafter, do the necessary, in order to hold to account the causes for what happened.+  He added: \u201cI think we should not jump to any conclusions to say any one teacher or principal had been the entry point for this Covid-19. Let\u2019s have a heart for the feelings of the teachers concerned.  \u201cThere is no indication at all as to whether they were complacent or broken the rules, and in some sense they were quite zealous in making sure that children were cared for. But perhaps (there were) some moments lost, a couple of minutes, hours.  +Nevertheless, this is not the time for us to pin and assign blame. The key is to make sure that we uplift and uphold the entire sector, in order to continue to give assurance to parents.+  \u201cPre-schools are an essential service in Singapore,\u201d he said. \u201cParents entrust the children to our pre-school sector, so they have peace of mind when they go to work.\u201d  Around 400 pre-school operators run about 1,900 centres with 180,000 children across Singapore.  Giving an overall update of the impact Covid-19 has had on the pre-school sector, Mr Lee said so far three children of pre-school age have tested positive for the virus, including two cases announced by the Health Ministry on Wednesday.  The first was a pupil at a pre-school in Choa Chu Kang, and while the other two children had not been in school for some time, they had either travelled with family or was linked to a family member who went abroad for work, said Mr Lee.  In total, 320 pre-school children have been given leave of absence, as they live with a person who has been put on quarantine.  Another 4,500 children and 1,200 staff in pre-schools have been issued leave of absence after returning from overseas from March 14.  Another 438 pre-school children and 170 staff have been issued stay-at-home notices, based on their travel history to any country.  Mr Lee said that pre-school attendance remains high since the coronavirus outbreak began this year, but he acknowledged that some parents prefer to keep their children at home.  \u201c(Some) think that the whole sector ought to perhaps be shut down for this reason. They have kept their children at home... or made alternative arrangements because of their concerns.  \u201cWe respect that, we understand that. And that is why ECDA has waived the one-day attendance requirement each month for them to be eligible for pre-school subsidies.\u201d  He noted that many parents, including those at the front lines such as healthcare professionals and public transport workers, do not have alternative caregiving arrangements.  Parents are \u201crightfully concerned\u201d about the latest cluster emerging in a pre-school, he said.  Teachers too are concerned, he said. \u201cSome are concerned about the health and well-being of their colleagues who have been affected. Some are concerned about themselves, other colleagues at other centres, about the efficacy of the measures to keep them and their centre safe.\u201d  Pre-schools have since January stepped up measures such as more frequent temperature-taking daily, restricting visitors and suspending excursions.  He said: \u201cWe, as a sector, need to maintain the measures that are needed at this time, and to uphold them to the highest standards.  \u201cOperators all know that we owe it to the parents, so they have peace of mind.

Measures announced then include a $4 billion package to keep workers in jobs and help companies with cash flow, $1.6 billion for a one-time payout to every Singaporean aged 21 and above and $800 million to support front-line agencies fighting the outbreak.  +Together, we can weather the storm and emerge stronger as one Singapore,+ said Mr Heng.","140":"As the clock ticks down on bars to close shop and public venues to restrict crowds, operators are scrambling to prepare for the new rules.  Some bars told The Straits Times yesterday that they remain unsure whether the latest measures meant to curb the spread of the coronavirus apply to them as they operate on restaurant or food stall licences.  Malls, meanwhile, said they were in the process of figuring out the extent to which they have to cut capacity, and how to enforce limits on footfall and group size.  On Tuesday, the Government announced that bars, cinemas and other entertainment outlets have to close from 11.59pm today until April 30, while gatherings outside of work and school will be capped at 10 people.  Other public venues, such as malls, museums and attractions, may stay open, but must reduce operating capacity to avoid having more than one person per 16 sq m of usable space - about the size of an HDB flat bedroom.  They must also ensure safe distancing measures, suspend shows and tours, and disperse groups of more than 10 or face penalties if they are found to have been a place of transmission for Covid-19.  To comply, City Square Mall will temporarily redirect traffic flow to a few manned entrances to restrict capacity, said developer and manager City Developments.  The entrance that connects to Farrer Park MRT station will remain open, a spokesman said.  Security personnel will also keep a lookout for large groups and disperse them, where necessary.

Bar manager Sim Sze Wei, 37, acknowledged the move was necessary, adding: +There is a lot of uncertainty, but the staff will be taken care of as much as possible.  +Like all the other bars, we will definitely face cash flow problems, so now we have to get creative on how we can sustain the business.+  Resorts World Sentosa said its attractions, which include Universal Studios Singapore and the S.E.A.

At the Flower Dome, for example, a maximum of 200 visitors will be allowed at any one point, down from the original holding capacity of 1,500.  Dr Cheng Wen-Haur, deputy chief executive of Wildlife Reserves Singapore, said its parks will remain open.  To ensure guests do not +bunch together+, all shows, animal interactions and token feedings have been suspended, along with most tram and boat operations.

SIA is an outstanding airline and strategic asset for Singapore,+ Mr Heng told Parliament on Thursday when he unveiled the Resilience Budget to provide a second round of measures to help firms and individuals affected by Covid-19.  +Through the government support for the aviation sector, and if necessary more direct support measures, we will make sure that SIA is able to come through this in good shape,+ he said.  Mr Heng added: +The SIA group sits at the heart of our aviation system and anchors our position as an air hub. In 2019, SIA accounted for over half of passenger traffic and cargo tonnage in Singapore.  +As the main hub carrier, SIA links us to the rest of the world. Many foreign airlines choose to come to Changi because they can tap on SIA+s connectivity to the rest of the region.+  He said: +A diminished SIA will undermine our air hub+s ability to recover from the crisis. Air travel will eventually resume when Covid-19 comes under control. Until then, SIA will need liquidity to tide over this outbreak.+  In this regard, SIA will benefit from the enhanced Jobs Support Scheme and the enhanced Aviation Support Package which will help reduce its operating expenditure, he said.  The airline has announced that it will slash 96 per cent of its capacity as countries, including Singapore, tighten their borders.  Analysts have suggested that SIA could receive support in the form of a working capital loan or subsidies.

The Government announced the move on Saturday as additional precautionary measures against the spread of Covid-19 here.  LTVP holders and those granted an IPA who are planning to enter or return to Singapore must obtain the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority+s (ICA) permission before they start their journey to Singapore by submitting their application for entry to ICA_nCoV_request@ica.gov.sg.  Existing student pass holders and those who have been granted IPA for a student pass must obtain the Ministry of Education+s (MOE) permission before starting their journey to the Republic.  MOE said it will take into consideration the course in which the student is enrolled and prioritise entry approval for those studying in publicly funded institutes of higher learning.  Student pass holders and those who have been granted an IPA for student pass should submit their application to their educational institution, which will then forward their application to MOE, the ministry said.  The entry approval measure comes on the heels of MOE+s announcement on Friday regarding more home-based learning across educational institutions, in the light of the recent spike of Covid-19 cases.  From April 1, all schools will conduct one day of home-based learning a week.  Primary schools will do so on Wednesdays, secondary schools on Thursdays, and junior colleges and centralised institutes on Fridays.  On Friday, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said that this move will better prepare parents and students for more days of home-based learning if and when required.  Less than 10 per cent of students and staff did not return to school on March 23 - the first day back after the week-long March holidays - after being placed on a 14-day leave of absence or stay-home notice.

In its announcement on Saturday, the Government said applicants who are granted permission to enter Singapore will be issued an approval letter of entry by ICA or MOE that is valid for two weeks.  Travellers must produce this approval letter of entry to airline staff upon checking in at the departure airport and to the immigration officer at the checkpoint upon arrival in Singapore.  Applicants are advised not to make travel plans to Singapore until approval has been granted by ICA or MOE.  Those arriving in Singapore without the approval letter of entry will not be allowed to clear immigration and will be required to fly out of Singapore within 48 hours at their own cost, ICA said.  ICA said it will cancel passes or rescind the IPA of those failing to comply with the order to exit.  The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has also been requiring all new and existing work-pass holders, including dependants, to obtain the ministry+s approval before beginning their journey to Singapore.  The entry approval applies to existing work-pass holders who are currently out of Singapore as well as those who have been granted IPA for a work pass and have yet to enter the country.  MOM said employers are required to apply for entry approval using the website: ICA_nCoV_request@ica.gov.sg  Work-pass holders whose application for entry approval has been rejected are instructed not to enter or return to Singapore and advised to apply again for the required approval.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Those who do not comply and fly to Singapore will have their work pass revoked and barred from future employment in Singapore, the Government said.  MOM said it would restrict the number of entry approvals for work-pass holders to very small numbers.  The implementation of entry approval is in place to help agencies regulate the inflow of people to Singapore in order to mitigate the risk of the import of Covid-19 cases.  Travellers who are granted entry approval will be placed on a 14-day stay-home notice upon their arrival.  Travellers were also reminded to submit a health and travel declaration via the SG Arrival Card e-Service before their arrival.  Those charged with making any false or misleading declarations may be jailed up to six months or fined up to $10,000 under the Infectious Diseases Act.  Those charged for subsequent offences may be jailed up to 12 months and fined up to $20,000.","143":"Infectious diseases experts here are urging people to stay home unless they are +100 per cent+ well, following news that some of the staff in the coronavirus cluster at PCF Sparkletots in Fengshan were at work while sick.  Dr Leong Hoe Nam, who practises at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, told The Straits Times: +If you look at the numbers, we+re hitting around 70 cases a day. If we do this consecutively for five days, we+d need a new National Centre for Infectious Diseases to hold the patients.  +If this goes on, our whole healthcare system will be overloaded.  +So everyone must play their part, no ifs or buts. If you+re even a little bit unwell, please don+t go out, stay at home. It+s high stakes now.+  Professor Paul Tambyah, from the National University of Singapore+s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, agreed.  +Right now when there is a worldwide coronavirus pandemic, it is best to stay home if one does not feel 100 per cent well,+ he said.  As of yesterday, there were 25 cases of infection in the PCF Fengshan cluster.  The pre-school principal was well when she went to work on March 17 but developed symptoms that afternoon. On that day, she had a meeting with her staff, and attended a course with other pre-school staff in the evening.  Most of the staff from the centre who tested positive for the virus began developing symptoms from March 20.  Nine family members of the principal also tested positive.  Dr Leong said that on average, an individual spreads the virus to only two to three people.

Citing a recent study on the spread of the coronavirus in Singapore, Prof Tambyah highlighted that 88 per cent of individuals did not transmit the infection to anyone, even when they were not in quarantine.  However, three or four patients would later become the source for some major clusters.  He said: +The vast majority of people do not spread (the virus responsible for Covid-19) to anyone.  +On the other hand, a few individuals become the index patients for large numbers of secondary and tertiary cases.+  Both Prof Tambyah and Dr Leong emphasised that it is better to refer to a +super-spreading event+, rather than a +super spreader+.  The term +super spreader+ pins a lot of responsibility and blame on a single individual, while in reality there may be other factors at play.  Dr Leong added: +We shouldn+t pin and judge people with retrospective vision. If anyone knew what would happen after a particular action was taken, if they knew it would lead to a spread, they wouldn+t have taken it.+  Related Story How a party became a +super-spreader+  There are several lessons to be learnt from the PCF cluster. Noting that the principal developed symptoms only in the afternoon, Dr Leong said workplaces should take temperatures thrice a day.  On the meeting that the principal attended, he added: +It+s a good reminder that we ought not to meet if possible. If you have to meet, an open-air environment is preferred to an air-conditioned one.+  Those in a meeting room should maintain a 1m to 2m distance from one another, and should declare if they are feeling unwell before joining the meeting. They should also not share food or drinks.","144":"Having lessons at home once a week is manageable even if disruptive for some families, said parents in response to the latest social distancing measure by the Ministry of Education, which begins next week.  But some parents and students wondered if it would make a difference in preventing the spread of the coronavirus.  Madam Grace Chua, 39, who has a Primary 5 son and Nursery 2 daughter, said parents had expected remote learning to occur. +I+m glad it+s not an entire block period of school closure, because it will catch parents off guard,+ she said.  The account manager, who is working from home, said: +It+s a good decision to space it out, so that there are fewer people and students out in public every week.+  She said her son is familiar with e-learning as his school holds it once every term. +He knows how to navigate the online platforms, and doesn+t require much supervision.+  But with tuition classes and swimming lessons also suspended, he misses his friends, she said. +I+d rather children be kept in schools, so that they have some interaction with friends, and things are kept as normal as possible.+  Secondary 3 student Xavier Lim said: +I+m glad and relieved that the Government is trying to safeguard students and mentally preparing us if schools need to close. But I+m not sure how much this will help to reduce contact, if teachers and students+ exposure to the public is minimised by only a day.+  Some parents have questioned why schools have remained open during the pandemic, even as other countries have shut them.  Housewife Liew Cheng Huan, 53, who has three children in secondary school, is concerned that schools can become Covid-19 clusters, citing the outbreak at the PAP Community Foundation Sparkletots centre at Fengshan.  Related Story Schools stay open, but Govt keeping close watch  Related Story One day of home-based study a week from April 1  +It highlights the potential of such an outbreak happening in schools.

Mrs Sophie Lam, 41, who runs a handicraft business and has twin daughters in Primary 6, said: +This is a start, and a big step for the Government to take. But one day of home-based learning doesn+t do much (in preventing the spread of the virus). I hope they can come up with a better arrangement fast.+  Students said home-based learning will help them keep up with the syllabus, in the event schools close.  Catholic Junior College student Dawn Liew, 17, suggested that online attendance can be taken to ensure all students are taking part, and subject content released according to the normal school timetable, so that +students have a meaningful learning experience+.  +If the necessary help were to be given to students and schools, like for example loaning laptops to lower-income students for the month, it could be just as effective as going to school, not to mention it being indubitably much safer,+ added the JC1 student.","145":"SINGAPORE - Stricter safe distancing rules to keep people at least 1m away from each other in public places kicked in on Friday (March 27).

The event, originally scheduled to be held from March 6 to 29, had been postponed in February before being cancelled in light of the stricter measures.  MOH+s latest advisory includes deferring or cancelling events regardless of size and limiting gatherings to 10 people or fewer.

The Straits Times+ senior education correspondent Sandra Davie responds.  Q What if parents do not work in essential services like the healthcare sector, but in jobs like retail, and cannot take leave on home-learning days?  A The Ministry of Education (MOE) has said that schools will remain open for a small group of students whose parents are not able to secure alternative childcare arrangements. Priority will be given to parents in essential services such as healthcare, but if you are unable to take leave on the days where your child will be doing home-learning, then approach the school for help.  All schools will have a small number of teachers in school to supervise students whose parents are not able to make alternative arrangements.  Student care centres will also be open to support these students.  Q Does home-based learning refer to e-lessons by teachers? And how many hours a day does this entail, and do students need to be supervised by their parents?  A Students can expect to have about four to five hours of learning on the day of home-based learning, of which two hours can be through the use of laptops or tablets.  So, home-based learning is not confined to e-learning or learning with computers.  Schools will plan and implement a home-based learning programme that best suits the lessons and the needs of their students.  Related Story Parents okay with move, but some wonder about efficacy  It can come in different forms. For example, schools may ask students to undertake specific pieces of homework or reading from their textbooks. Sometimes, for subjects such as art, schools may drop off hard-copy packages at a student+s home.  Schools may also ask students to go through online materials in the Singapore Student Learning Space or the Learning Management Systems. Teachers will also be able to monitor the students+ learning progress through these systems.  MOE said that only young children, in lower primary, may need some supervision and help. Those in upper primary and secondary schools, and junior colleges, should be able to do home-based learning on their own.  If you have young children and are not able to take leave on the days where your child will be doing home-based learning, then approach the school for help.  Q In the event that schools have to close, will major exams, such as the Primary School Leaving Examination, the O levels and A levels still go on?  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  A Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said yesterday that exams such as the PSLE, O levels and A levels are major milestones, so they will continue to be held.

He said that some topics, for example, can be dropped.  Examinations will continue, and students will be graded fairly.","148":"SINGAPORE - From spaced-out queues to enter malls to the use of alternate stools at hawker centres, safe distancing was largely in place across the island on Friday (March 27), as strict new regulations kicked in to limit crowds and minimise close contact in public areas.  The temporary closure of entertainment venues did little to deter Singaporeans from venturing out, with healthy crowds observed at malls, hawker centres and supermarkets.  Crowd control measures were in full force at several malls The Straits Times visited, with most sealing the majority of their entrances, including underpasses to MRT stations and other buildings, to control traffic flow.  Starting Friday, malls, attractions and other public venues have had to limit their capacity and disperse groups of more than 10 or face penalties if they are found to have been a place of transmission for Covid-19.  Those who intentionally sit less than 1m away from another person in a public place or on a fixed seat marked as not to be occupied or who stand in a queue less than the same distance away from another person will now also be guilty of an offence.  If convicted, they can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both, under updates to the Infectious Diseases Act published in the Government Gazette on Thursday (March 26) night.  Those out and about on Friday said they were adapting well to the minor inconveniences caused by the new rules, though they pointed out gaps in some of the measures and on public transport.  At Sembawang Hills Food Centre, most of the lunchtime crowd was seen following the alternate-seating arrangements.  But engineer Tan Chin Lee, 40, who sat next to her two colleagues, noted that leaving a seat empty between them would not be enough to form a 1m gap.

While they declined to reveal by how much they have had to reduce capacity, operators said they have had to take drastic steps to comply, such as sealing key entrances, closing carparks and deploying extra manpower to count visitor numbers.  Events, atrium sales and performances have also been suspended.  Related Story Safe distancing rules kick in: Readers share what they saw in public places  In Orchard Road on Friday afternoon, crowds filled the ground-level walkway between Ngee Ann City and Wisma Atria as the underpass had been shut.

Singapore Business Federation chief executive Ho Meng Kit said sectors that are still hiring could include security, cleaning, infocomm technology (ICT), manufacturing and engineering.  +These sectors are likely to have a fair share of both permanent and temporary positions, given the manpower challenges with the more severe travel restrictions imposed here and globally,+ he said.  He added that SBF will expand its SBF ManpowerConnect scheme - which links employers with excess Chinese work pass holders to those with a shortage - to include helping companies requiring Singapore resident workers.  OCBC chief economist Selena Ling said sectors like logistics may demand workers as people order more things online such as groceries and food, and electronics.  Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat had said on Thursday, when he announced the initiative, that the public sector will take the lead in speeding up hiring plans for roles in emerging areas, recruiting for long-term roles in essential services and offering temporary jobs to handle the increase in Covid-19-related operations.  The jobs must be immediately available to help people who need to get back to work quickly, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on Friday (March 27).  About 3,000 jobs under the initiative were listed on Friday as part of a virtual career fair at SGUnitedJobs.gov.sg.  As of 4pm on Friday, almost 1,500 job applications had been received, said a spokesman for government agency Workforce Singapore (WSG).  Available jobs include customer service assistants, social service officers, relief teachers and ambulance drivers.  About 80 per cent of the vacancies are for temporary jobs of up to one year, said Mrs Teo, adding that the pay range of jobs on offer is $1,700 to $5,800 a month.  She said that although job seekers may prefer a permanent role, the initiative helps those who need to find a job immediately as they have children, mortgages, elderly parents or other money commitments.  Getting back to work quickly also puts workers in a better position to continue their career when the economy recovers, she said.  +Their resume continues to build up (as) they continue to be trained and continue to have relevant work experience,+ she said.  She noted that virtual career fairs enable job matching to continue amid the safe distancing measures rolled out to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The situation is different from that of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, when large-scale job fairs could be organised.  DPM Heng had also unveiled on Thursday an enhanced Jobs Support Scheme which provides employers a wage subsidy of 25 per cent for each local employee on the first $4,600 of monthly wages, with higher support of 50 per cent for those in food services, and 75 per cent for those in aviation and tourism. The original scheme had an 8 per cent wage subsidy.  Mrs Teo said that it is too early to say how large an impact the new measures will make, but she assured Singaporeans that \u201cif we need to do more, we will find some ways to do it\u201d.  Speaking to reporters after observing virtual networking sessions between employers and jobseekers at WSG\u2019s office, she said the expected number of job vacancies and retrenchments this year had been a concern even before the covonavirus outbreak.  Jobseekers or those displaced are likely to face some difficulties this year, she added.  Therefore, the Government is not depending on any one single scheme but rather a whole range, with the top priority being to support employers to keep as many local employees as possible.  Mrs Teo said: \u201cIn doing so, we hope to minimise the number of businesses that will have to implement other cost-cutting measures, like wages, and possibly even displacing some of their workers.\u201d  She added: \u201cIf you can keep that number as low as possible, then you have a better chance of helping (displaced workers) to move on to something else.\u201d  She also said the National Wages Council, which typically releases recommendations for wage practices at end-May, will do so by end-March.  She said she has asked the council to discuss whether companies that implement shorter working hours should allow workers to take on a second job to boost their income.

The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), which organises the annual forum, said it has decided in close consultation with the Singapore Government not to convene this year+s edition.  The Straits Times had first reported on the forum+s cancellation, based on sources familiar with the matter.  In a statement on Friday (March 27), the London-based IISS noted that many countries have imposed travel restrictions in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which may still be in force in early June.  +Given that the Dialogue draws participation from more than 40 countries, many of which have imposed such restrictions, the IISS has decided that the only sensible course at this point is to notify delegates and other interested parties that the event will not take place this year,+ the institute said.  +We will shortly begin work to ensure an exceptionally strong IISS Shangri-La Dialogue in 2021,+ it added.  This marks the first time that the annual Shangri-La Dialogue has been called off since it was first launched in 2002. It is usually held in June at the Shangri-La Hotel.  On its part, Singapore took the unprecedented step of not allowing short-term visitors to enter or transit through the country from Monday (March 23), to reduce the risk of importing Covid-19 cases.  The authorities also announced on Tuesday (March 24) that all events and mass gatherings, such as conferences, festivals, and sporting events, must be deferred or cancelled until at least April 30, regardless of size. Previously, they were to be limited to fewer than 250 participants.  In a Facebook post, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said it would be a significant challenge to hold the Shangri-La Dialogue (SLD) as scheduled in early June, looking at the course of the Covid-19 pandemic.  +Government leaders and delegations from nearly 40 countries attend this premier security dialogue, so it\u2019s important to give advance notice now. I thank all our defence partners for their strong support to Singapore and the SLD over the years. We look forward to resuming the SLD next year,+ he said.  This year would have been the 19th edition of the talks organised by the IISS. The forum gathers top defence officials from around the world to discuss security issues affecting the region, such as maritime security and regional stability.  Bilateral meetings and courtesy calls usually take place on its sidelines, and it is credited with building confidence and fostering practical cooperation among its participants.  Last year+s event had involved 33 ministerial-level delegates, more than 30 chiefs of defence force and senior defence officials, and academics from 47 countries.  Related Story Interactive: How coronavirus is spreading across the world  Among them were then US Acting Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan and Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe, as well as representatives from the United Kingdom, Australia, Malaysia and South Korea.  Mr David Boey, a member of the Ministry of Defence+s Advisory Council on Community Relations in Defence, told ST that the meeting would be untenable as it is uncertain how long countries will close their borders in response to the rapidly evolving Covid-19 situation.  Even if delegates can get to Singapore when airline flights have dried up, defence ministers and armed forces chiefs are likely to be heavily engaged in their home nation+s efforts to fight the virus, he added.  Mr Boey also noted that event highlights such as courtesy calls and close mingling between delegates cannot take place as before during this period of social distancing.  +As the absence of such activities would dilute the value of the security talks, it is understandable and prudent for the event to be postponed.+  He noted that issues such as the South China Sea, sea piracy, and the threat of terrorism remain pertinent even as the coronavirus outbreak continues.  +It is important for... efforts such as the Shangri-La Dialogue to stay active, perhaps by video conference or online workshops on topical security issues, to keep potential flashpoints in check.+","151":"SINGAPORE - About 88,000 self-employed persons will receive cash payouts of $3,000 each in May, July and October this year to help them in this time of economic uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic.  The Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (Sirs), which will cost $1.2 billion in total, will be open to those who earn a Net Trade Income of no more than $100,000, live in a property with an annual value of no more than $13,000 and do not own two or more properties.  They must also have started self-employment on or before March 25 and must not earn any income as employees.  If they are married, they and their spouse together must not own two or more properties, and the spouse+s Assessable Income must not exceed $70,000.  The scheme is part of a landmark $48.4 billion supplementary Budget announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Thursday (March 26) to help Singapore cope with the coronavirus outbreak.  The Resilience Budget comes on top of the $6.4 billion package that was announced about a month ago to cushion the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.  MOM said on Friday that about 50,000 self-employed persons are currently receiving Workfare payouts of between $1,133 and $2,667 a year. They will be eligible for Sirs.  +Due to the extraordinary circumstances brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, we have broadened the eligibility criteria beyond Workfare to enable more self-employed persons to qualify for Sirs,+ the ministry added.  Those who are 37 years old and above in 2020 and declared positive self-employment income to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore or the Central Provident Fund Board for Work Year 2018 will not need to apply for Sirs.  They will be automatically notified of their eligibility via letter and SMS, and will receive their first Sirs payout in May, said MOM.  Others who are eligible may apply for Sirs. More details on the scheme and application process will be released at a later date.","152":"SINGAPORE - Sport Singapore (SportSG) will continue to review its physical distancing procedures, which kicked in at ActiveSG venues on Monday last week. Rules such as lane segregation at tracks and swimming pools were enforced by the national agency to minimise gatherings but led to overcrowding in some lanes.  This week, SportSG announced more physical distancing rules after the Ministry of Health (MOH) imposed stricter new measures.  Organised activities must be kept to a maximum of 10 participants with a one metre spacing between them. The operating capacity of facilities, such as gyms, stadiums, swimming pools and indoor sport halls, is restricted to one person per 16 sq m.  To prevent crowding at gyms, efforts to increase the space between equipment will be taken. Users will also be reminded to wipe equipment after use and maintain physical distancing.  A SportSG spokesman told The Straits Times: +In view of MOH+s advisory on March 24, we have updated our advisory for sport and physical exercise\/activity, to provide operational guidance on the tighter physical distancing measures. These measures are to be strictly followed by private operators and national sports associations.  +We appreciate the public feedback and patience as we adjust our measures. We are committed to work together to enable everyone to exercise and stay healthy. We also appeal to all our visitors to practise social responsibility.+  The new preventive steps apply to all ActiveSG stadiums, sports halls, gyms, swimming complexes and studios. These facilities have also implemented a single point of entry where possible to facilitate temperature taking (except stadiums) and recording of visitor details.  Pools remain open as there is currently no evidence suggesting the virus can be spread through water and experts have said that it is generally safe to go swimming.  Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam noted that the water and chlorine in swimming pools could help to kill the virus.  Related Story Coronavirus: Physical distancing measures at public sports facilities face hurdles  Dr Leong, who practises at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, also advised against lingering around the pool area.  While the risk of transmission from surfaces is relatively low, professor of medicine at the University of Tennessee+s College of Nursing Roberta Lavin told US Masters Swimming the bigger concern is the people one meets and mixes with at the pool.  When several swimmers go into a lane together, the few moments at the wall in close proximity to one another can be a prime opportunity for viral transmission if one person is carrying the virus.","153":"SINGAPORE - Those who have been financially affected by the coronavirus outbreak through losing their jobs or income will be able to apply for a one-time cash assistance of $500 from April 1.  Under the Temporary Relief Fund, lower- to middle-income Singaporeans and permanent residents who are not on ComCare assistance will be able to get immediate financial assistance to help with basic living expenses.  Applications will open at all social service offices (SSOs) run by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) as well as all community centres from April 1 to 30.  Those who face challenges in finding new employment because of the pandemic can also apply for the Covid-19 Support Grant, which will provide longer-term financial assistance and job support.  From May 1, those who are eligible will receive $800 a month for three months if they also commit to receiving employment and training support from Workforce Singapore (WSG) and the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i).  Recipients of the grant who continue to need support for a longer period will be assessed for ComCare assistance, said MSF on Friday (March 27).  The two financial assistance schemes were part of a slate of measures in a supplementary Budget announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Thursday to help Singapore cope with the coronavirus pandemic.  Details of how to apply were announced by the MSF on Friday.  The landmark $48.4 billion Resilience Budget comes on top of the $6.4 billion package that was announced about a month ago to cushion the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.  Those who receive the Temporary Relief Fund will not have to submit the same supporting documents to apply for the Covid-19 Support Grant if they need longer-term assistance, said MSF.  However, they will have to undertake that they will participate actively in their job search and retraining programmes under WSG or e2i.  Eligibility criteria for Covid-19 support schemes  1. Temporary Relief Fund: One-off $500 cash assistance in April - Singapore citizens or permanent residents who have lost their jobs or faced a personal income loss of at least 30 per cent due to Covid-19 - Household income of \u2264$10,000, or per capita household income of \u2264$3,100, before their employment or income was affected - Not currently receiving ComCare assistance 2. Covid-19 Support Grant: Monthly cash grant of $800 for 3 months - Singapore citizens or permanent residents aged 16 years and above who are unemployed due to retrenchment or contract termination as a result of Covid-19 - Household income of \u2264$10,000, or per capita household income of \u2264$3,100 before unemployment - Live in a property with an annual value of \u2264$21,000 - Not currently receiving ComCare assistance - Recipients must have been employed as a full-time or part-time permanent or contract staff prior to unemployment, and agree to actively participate in job searches or attend a training programme under Workforce Singapore or the Employment and Employability Institute 3. The Courage Fund: One-time lump sum of up to $1,000 - Experienced a complete or partial (of at least 10 per cent) loss of household income due to Covid-19 - Household income of \u2264$3,900, or per capita household income of \u2264$1,350, before being affected by Covid-19 - Those receiving ComCare assistance can apply  MSF also said that while household income is considered as part of the eligibility criteria for the assistance schemes, more than one eligible individual from the same household can get help from the Covid-19 Support Grant.  Those who are already receiving ComCare assistance, however, will not be able to apply for either the Temporary Relief Fund or the Covid-19 Support Grant.  MSF said that this is because they already receive comprehensive support for their basic living expenses, including cash assistance as well as assistance with household bills and medical bills.  +If ComCare clients require more assistance due to changes in financial circumstances, SSO will work with them to review their assistance package,+ said the ministry.  Apart from government initiatives, Singaporeans have also donated to support those affected by the pandemic, with more than $5.6 million raised for The Courage Fund, a central donation platform, said MSF.  The fund will help dependants of those who succumb to the virus; healthcare workers, frontline workers and community volunteers who contract the virus in the course of duty; and lower-income families who experience financial difficulties because a family member contracted the virus or has to serve quarantine, stay-home notices or mandatory leave of absence.  Eligible lower-income households will be able to apply to receive a one-time lump sum of up to $1,000 from The Courage Fund at SSOs from April 6.  Application details will be available from the National Council of Social Service+s website by end-March. Those who currently receive ComCare assistance can apply for this scheme.","154":"SINGAPORE - More than 30 companies have been ordered to stop work immediately after the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) found that they have not been following safe distancing measures.  In the past week, the ministry issued 34 stop-work orders and 36 remedial orders, the result of a four-day long operation, which saw its officers conducting checks on more than 100 companies.  It said on Friday (March 27) that these companies were required to make +immediate rectifications+ and urged other businesses to keep themselves updated on the latest advisories.  Under government orders, employers should defer or cancel all workplace events.  They should also place their employees on work-from-home arrangements wherever possible, and take precautions such as making sure employees work staggered hours and sit apart if they have to go into the office.  Mr Raymond Koh, an MOM inspector, noted that it was also important to educate employers on best practices.  He said: +Where we can, we are sharing good practices that other companies have done to support employers in protecting their employees and loved ones, and the public at large. Beyond enforcement, it is important to help employers understand the gaps that must be rectified to limit the spread of Covid-19 at work premises.+","155":"SINGAPORE - Those who abuse and harass private security officers carrying out their work could be liable under new offences that the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is looking into instituting.  MHA said it intends to better protect private security officers from harassment or abuse, and is looking at amending the Private Security Industry Act in 2021.  In a statement on Friday (March 27), MHA said private security officers play an important role in ensuring the safety and security of the premises to which they are deployed.  +However, during the course of their work, they can face verbal and sometimes physical abuse. MHA takes a serious view of the harassment and abuse of private security officers,+ said the ministry.  The move comes in response to several highly publicised reports of security officers being abused last year, and after much lobbying by security associations and unions to better protect them.  Outrage was sparked last Deepavali, when a condominium resident was caught on camera verbally abusing a security guard over parking charges.  Security associations and unions lauded the Ministry\u2019s move.  President of the Association for Certified Security Agencies (Acsa) Robert Wiener said the condominium abuse incident was just the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d.  \u201cOur people get abused all the time while doing their job,\u201d said Mr Wiener and added that he was very pleased to hear of the changes.  About 30 per cent of security officers have experienced abuse while at work, according to a survey of 1,549 officers between November 2019 and February 2020, commissioned by the Union of Security Employees (USE).  56 per cent of the officers surveyed said they experienced abuse at least once a month. Another 48 per cent said they faced abuse from the general public.  Executive secretary of USE Steve Tan said security officers are prone to abuse, as their jobs often require them to \u201cprovoke people\u201d , by getting them to abide by the rules of the premises.  \u201cThis is their job and if they get abused because of it, that\u2019s definitely unfair to them,\u201d said Mr Tan.  He added that enhanced protection is welcome, as it sends a strong signal that abuse is not allowed.  The Security Industry Council (SIC) said protecting the welfare and dignity of security officers is of paramount importance.  \u201cThis is especially so as officers not only perform day-to-day safety and protection duties, but also play a crucial frontline role in national emergencies such as amidst stepped-up Covid-19 measures,\u201d said the SIC in a statement. The council represents three security associations: USE, ACSA, and the Security Association Singapore.  SIC said: \u201cThe impending amendments to the PSIA in 2021 is a step in the right direction to minimise any form of abuse to our officers.\u201d  MHA is also looking into changing the annual mandatory assessment of security agencies that is conducted by the police and the Manpower Ministry.  In the light of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, security agencies will not need to participate in this year+s security agency grading exercise (Sage), said the ministry. Their grade from last year is to be extended till Dec 31, 2021.  However, firms can still volunteer to participate in the grading exercise, and the cut-off points from last year+s assessment will be used for grading purposes.  The ministry and the police have also reviewed this grading exercise with industry partners and a tripartite taskforce formed last year has agreed that future assessments will be on a pass or fail basis, instead of the current grading system of A, B, C and D.  Security agencies will go through the assessment only closer to their licence renewal date, and must pass the test for their licences to be renewed. This is unlike the current arrangement where all agencies undergo assessment at the same time.  Related Story Study to look at work conditions, abuse faced by security officers  Related Story New initiatives launched to support private security officers who suffer abuse at work  Firms will need to demonstrate +substantive security capabilities and outcomes+, and the new assessment framework will include some voluntary modules which could be taken so the agencies can showcase their capabilities, said the ministry.  Companies who meet those higher standards can renew their license for two years, up from one year currently. Accordingly, these agencies will only need to undergo assessment once every two years.  Mr Raj Joshua Thomas, president of Security Association Singapore, said this competency-based system is more transparent, as buyers of security services can immediately identify the competencies of the different firms, instead of looking at a single grade to determine the firm\u2019s capabilities.  More details will be announced by early 2021, said the ministry.","156":"SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - While most Singaporeans were fast asleep, Ms Roslina Toh was combing MRT stations, void decks and neighbourhood parks every night for over a week.  Together with a team of volunteers from a project called Home Away From Home, Ms Toh, a 23-year-old student, has been scouring these areas in the wee hours to locate workers who may be left without a home after the Malaysian government implemented its movement control order, which has since been extended to April 14.  Malaysia+s movement restrictions, which came into effect at midnight last Wednesday (March 18), left workers and their employers scrambling to make accommodation arrangements.  On Wednesday, the Manpower Ministry (MOM) urged employers here to find longer-term accommodation for their Malaysian workers.  While the Government will not be extending temporary housing support for these workers past March 31, an MOM spokesman said on Tuesday that a multi-agency effort led by MOM has helped about 10,000 affected workers find housing.  However, Ms Toh said: +Every night, we still find workers without a place to stay, although the authorities have done a good job and we see fewer cases every night.+  Home Away From Home has taken over 50 affected workers to Transit Point @ Margaret Drive, a newly opened shelter for the homeless run by New Hope Community Services.  Reports of Malaysian workers sleeping rough at Kranji MRT station drove Ms Toh and her core team of volunteers to take action and start the project.  When TNP visited the area around Marsiling MRT station last Friday night, six workers said they had been sleeping at void decks or pavilions.  One of them, a Malaysian woman from Sabah who declined to be named, was found resting on the steps of a covered multi-purpose space.  In between sobs, the 23-year-old vegetable stall assistant told TNP: +I came to Singapore for my work permit application, but my employer said it will be finalised only next month.

The Ministry of Health ruled on Tuesday (March 24) that all Singaporeans returning from Britain and the US from 11.59pm on Wednesday will have to serve their 14-day stay-home notices in dedicated facilities instead of their own homes.  This was because those coming in from both these countries account for the largest share of imported cases by far. About 1,200 people a day have been returning from these two countries.  Returnees will have their own room and bathroom and all meals provided so that they avoid physical contact with other individuals, the MOH said.

Mr Chua, a mammal scientist at the National University of Singapore+s (NUS) Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, told The Straits Times that he had initially considered staying put in the US to finish the semester but the escalating crisis there and repeated reminders from NUS and the Singapore Embassy to come home prompted him to change his mind.

Thankfully, the Alaska Airlines flight departed on time and Mr Chua found himself in San Francisco with about a day to spare.

That is because the elderly are vulnerable to virus infections, including Covid-19, she said.  Those with symptoms of acute respiratory illness who are prescribed five days+s medical leave at home should avoid contact with all family members of any age, even at mealtimes, said Professor Leo.  She added that if it is absolutely necessary to interact with others at home, those on medical leave should put on a surgical mask.  Separately, they should also take care of their personal hygiene, washing their hands frequently with water and soap or using hand sanitiser.  They should keep their surroundings clean, and preferably use a dedicated toilet which others in the house do not use.  If this is not possible, the toilet they use must be kept clean.  Prof Leo said: +This is necessary as we learn more about Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19.+  The virus can be spread through both direct and indirect droplet transmission, she added.  This could take place through close face-to-face contact within 1m to 2m of an infected person, or through interaction with a contaminated environment or contaminated objects.  Prof Leo said: +NCID would like to stress that anyone who has acute respiratory illness, regardless of severity, should put on a surgical mask and seek early medical consultation.+  Common symptoms of acute respiratory illness include fever, cough, sore throat and runny nose.  +If the doctor provides five days+ rest at home, please adhere closely to that - rest at home and do not leave the house,+added Prof Leo.

This is why the Government also completely changed its policy response and set aside a further $48.4 billion to support businesses, workers and families - a Supplementary Budget over seven times the initial $6.4 billion worth of measures to cushion the Covid-19 fallout, said Mr Lee.  While the combined $55 billion to combat the coronavirus is intended to see the country until the end of the year, Singaporeans must be psychologically prepared for things to worsen in the coming months, he said.  In such a scenario, the Government is prepared to tap on the reserves again.  \u201cWe have the dry powder,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we need to do more, when we need to do more, we will do that down the road.\u201d  Mr Lee noted that economies around the world have been drastically hit as the flow of goods and people reach a standstill. As an open economy, Singapore is particularly hard hit, especially in industries such as aviation, tourism and hotels, he added.  \u201cIt is going to last quite a long time: it is not a V-shaped down dip, it is not a U-shaped dip,\u201d he warned.  \u201cIf you are lucky, you can sustain it at a diminished level for quite a long time; if you are not lucky, it will keep on going down, and some pieces (of the economy) are going to have a lot of difficulty, just staying in existence.\u201d  The Government\u2019s aim is very clear, he said - to protect jobs and help companies stay in business by reducing their costs. Key industries like aviation will be helped so they can \u201ccontinue in semi-suspended animation, but able to come back to life when the opportunities come\u201d.  \u201cThere will be ups and downs,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, it is critical that we go into this eyes open, (with) strong leadership, good government, united and determined to see this through.\u201d","160":"As waves of returning Singaporeans bring the coronavirus home with them, the last thing the stretched healthcare system needs is a new local cluster.  But on Wednesday night, worrying news surfaced that staff at a PAP Community Foundation (PCF) pre-school had been infected.  At least 15 staff have tested positive, plus another five family members. The country+s largest pre-school operator has closed all its centres, not just to disinfect them, but to review operations.  Singapore+s fight against the virus is at an inflection point, and whether it wins the battle could hinge on the number of local clusters to surface in the next few weeks.  If too many individuals and groups get infected here, the system will be overwhelmed. Even more drastic measures may ensue, such as closing schools and workplaces.  But if local spread can be contained, then resources can be funnelled towards the thousands of people coming back from high-risk countries such as Britain and the United States, and making sure that infections from this group do not erupt into clusters of their own.  After a few weeks - hopefully - imported cases will start to taper off, and the number of new cases each day will also begin to stabilise. That is when some of the current restrictions can be eased.  When a cluster forms, the knock-on effect on labour, and the cost to contain its spread, is tremendous.  Not only do patients have to be treated and monitored, and premises cleaned, others must get tested, contact tracing done, and people ordered to be under quarantine or on stay-home notice.  The numbers are telling: As of yesterday, over 400 people were still in hospital, with 18 requiring intensive care. Another 87 were in isolation. In addition, over 3,200 individuals remained under quarantine, with another 38,000 on stay-home notices.  In the case of PCF, the decision to close one centre for one day snowballed into the closure of 360 pre-school centres - affecting over 40,000 children - for four days, as more employees in the first centre were found to be sick.  Personal responsibility goes a long way towards taming these numbers.  This includes practising good hygiene, not going out if you do not have to, and seeing the doctor and staying at home if unwell.  Indeed, the pre-school cluster is one which may have been minimised, or may not even have materialised, if staff had not been at work when they felt sick.    The decision to close one PCF pre-school centre for one day snowballed into the closure of 360 centres, affecting over 40,000 children. ST PHOTO: GIN TAY    Employers must reinforce this message with their workers. For this period, they could also waive the need for a medical certificate for staff to call in sick.  The authorities, in efforts to contain the spread of the virus, have tightened border controls and imposed travel restrictions, pulled the plug on most group entertainment and activities, and indicated that they will come down hard on those who flout the rules.  Yet, there are still people on stay-home notices sneaking out for meals or inviting friends home, and others who lie about where they have been, doctor-hop, gather in large groups or go out when ill.  All it takes is for one thoughtless action to negate the best rules and guidelines, and derail the efforts of the thousands of medical, security, cleaning and other front-line staff working flat out to cope.  It is not always easy to decide if you are really sick. If in doubt, stay home.  Changing the way we think, and thinking things through, will go a long way towards protecting ourselves, our loved ones and the people around us.  And that is how the war against the virus may be won.","161":"SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - She was in the Philippines on home leave, but her employer in Singapore terminated her work permit before she could even return.  Sharing the story of the Filipina, who is a foreign domestic worker (FDW) here, Mr Michael Khan, director of employment agency Workforce Manpower, told The New Paper: +She wanted to come back, but her employer did not want her to return because she was afraid she might bring the virus back.  +Her employer told her she could not afford to pay her if she was quarantined, and just decided to cancel her work permit. The maid is now jobless, and very unhappy about it.+  This is an example of employers taking extreme measures in response to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) announcement on March 15 that all new or returning FDWs must serve a 14-day stay-home notice.  On top of that, growing tensions between FDWs and employers over rest-day arrangements have surfaced, even before MOM+s advisory last Saturday urged maids to stay home on their rest days.  On Wednesday (March 25), MOM said it would step up inspections at Lucky Plaza, City Plaza and Peninsula Plaza to disperse any large groups of FDWs. Its officers were spotted patrolling the shopping centres last Sunday.  A spokesman for the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (Home), a charity advocating migrant workers+ rights, said some FDWs have had their salaries withheld because they spent their rest day outside, against their employers+ wishes.  Employment agencies TNP spoke to added that some employers have threatened to cancel their FDWs+ work permits in order to force them into staying home, or to stop them from returning on home leave to countries where Covid-19 cases have spiked.  Mr Khan said employers are worried about not knowing who their FDWs come into contact with on their rest days.  He added: +Employers have legitimate concerns, especially those with elderly parents or young children at home.+  Ms Lynn Ng, who runs employment agency Achieve Employment, said: +Some of the maids feel it is unfair that their employers can go out while they themselves can+t.+  WORK WITH NO PAY  +However, the MOM advisory helped us explain the situation to them, and more of them have decided to stay home.+  Some FDWs who have chosen to stay home on their rest days end up doing work without getting paid.  The Home spokesman said: +It may be difficult for (FDWs) to assert their rights for fear of displeasing their employers, or getting terminated.+  Mr Khan added that it was hard to draw the line between simple favours and extra work that FDWs should be paid for.  However, one employer, Ms Sherlyn Soh, said her FDW voluntarily decided to forgo her day off and is compensated accordingly.  The 44-year-old career coach said: +I have an eight-year-old daughter, so naturally I am concerned. But my helper and I discussed it openly and respectfully, and she was very understanding.+  According to a spokesman for the Foreign Domestic Worker Association for Social Support and Training (Fast), one FDW needed to remit money but was prevented from going out on her rest day by her employer.  Fast helped to mediate the situation and the employer accompanied the FDW to the nearest mall for the remittance.  Related Story Coronavirus: MOM will revoke work passes of migrant workers in large gatherings if they refuse to disperse  Mr Shamsul Kamar, executive director of the Centre for Domestic Employees, said it has received 20 per cent more calls from both employers and FDWs on its helpline in the past month compared with the month before.  They were seeking clarity on how MOM+s advisory would impact them.  He said: +Both parties should mutually agree on rest-day arrangements, since the rest day is fundamentally the right of a (domestic worker).+","162":"SINGAPORE - While the cancellation of the Netball Super League (NSL) two weeks before the competition wrapped up left teams disappointed, they also felt it was the best option amid the ongoing conoravirus pandemic.  Netball Singapore (NS) announced on Friday (March 27) that the tournament, which was suspended indefinitely on Tuesday, would be aborted owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, making it the first major local sports competition to be called off.  The semi-finals, preliminary final and play-offs for fifth place were supposed to take place this weekend while the final was scheduled for April 4 at Our Tampines Hub.  Mission Mannas vice-captain Vanessa Lee said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty as to when all this will end so if we\u2019re just going to keep it to an open date and not know when it\u2019ll take place, it\u2019s going to be hard to train and prepare for it, so cancelling it is a good call.  \u201cWe\u2019re all disappointed that it\u2019s cancelled because we can\u2019t complete what we started and we are only two weeks away from the final. But in light of the current situation, it\u2019s the best thing to do.\u201d  Mannas were set to play Sneakers Stingrays in Saturday\u2019s (March 28) semi-finals.  The two round-robin stages started on Feb 8 and were completed on March 22.  With the season ending prematurely, Sneakers, who amassed 28 points, have been crowned champions, with the Mannas (18) runners-up and two-time defending champions Blaze Dolphins (16) finishing third.  Stingrays coach Goh Seck Tuck said: \u201cOf course we always hope we can play till the last game and rightfully win the championship but we\u2019ve shown that we have been quite consistent.  \u201cIt\u2019s quite a shame that the whole team couldn\u2019t complete it on a high note but in this present situation, it\u2019s the best that can happen.\u201d  Most of the games this season were played behind closed doors.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  On Monday (March 23), the six international players who had joined the league in the second round were forced to fly back to their native Fiji following uncertainty over flights owing to the Covid-19 outbreak.  The NSL was then postponed indefinitely after the Ministry of Health announced the next day that all sporting events, regardless of size, must be deferred or cancelled, with the measure taking effect until at least April 30.  However, NS decided to halt the competition completely, with chief executive Cyrus Medora saying: \u201cWhile the current decision is that all sports stop until April 30, we understand that could very well be extended with the large number of Singapore citizens and long-term residents still to return.\u201d  Other local events have also been disrupted by the virus, with the Singapore Premier League football competition, along with all its clubs\u2019 training sessions, suspended on Tuesday.  The Singapore Swimming Association (SSA) has also postponed the May 14-17 Singapore National Swimming Championships and June\u2019s 51st Singapore National Age Group Swimming Championships indefinitely. The May 29-31 Fina Diving Grand Prix Singapore has been also cancelled.  All national youth training (youth club\/affiliates) will cease until April 30 and youths will also be excused from national team training.  Training sessions for the national team may proceed if limited to 10 people and with appropriate screening measures.  Athletes and coaches will maintain at least one metre spacing between each other while ensuring that there is only one person per 16 sq m of usable space, said the SSA.","163":"SINGAPORE - As countries across the world implement measures to flatten the curve of Covid-19 infections, some netizens, many unidentified, are using music, dance and memes to spread the safe distancing message and bring cheer amid the pandemic.

They will also be able to buy up to only six cans of canned products, five litres of cooking oil and $30 of frozen poultry, where there were previously no limits.  Existing purchasing limits for instant noodles, rice, eggs, fresh poultry and vegetables remain unchanged.  These changes were announced by FairPrice on Friday (March 27) after it saw an increase in shoppers and the amount each bought in recent days.  +The new purchase limits continue to be set slightly higher than what a typical shopper purchases and is sufficient to meet the daily grocery needs of an average family in Singapore,+ it said in a statement. +Daily essentials remain available, as there are sufficient stockpiles of food while supply lines remain largely intact.+  The purchase limits per customer at the more than 200 FairPrice outlets islandwide now are:  - Paper products: Two packs (toilet paper, facial tissues, kitchen towels)  - Instant noodles\/pasta: Two packs  - Rice: 10kg  - Vegetables: $30  - Fresh, frozen and processed poultry: $30  - Eggs: Three packs of 10 or one tray of 30 per customer  - Canned products: Six cans (choice of meat, fish or vegetables)  - Cooking oil: Five litres  FairPrice group+s chief executive officer Seah Kian Peng said the rapidly changing situation means more revisions to the list could follow.  +FairPrice will continue to assess the evolving Covid-19 situation closely and will take all necessary precautionary measures to protect the interests of the community we serve during this difficult time,+ said Mr Seah.  The limits were first implemented on Feb 9 and last revised on March 17.

They can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or face both penalties upon conviction under updates to the Infectious Diseases Act made by the Ministry of Health and published in the Government Gazette on Thursday (March 26) night.  The latest regulations, which came into effect at 11.59pm on Thursday, seek to give legal force to safe distancing measures announced on Tuesday by the multi-ministry task force tackling the coronavirus pandemic in Singapore.  These limit gatherings outside of work and school to 10 persons or fewer, and ensure that physical distancing of at least one metre is maintained in non-transient settings such as at coffee shops, restaurants, and shopping malls.  Similar, if not tougher, restrictions are also in place in countries around the world as the number of Covid-19 patients cross the 500,000 mark, with over 23,000 deaths. Singapore reported 52 new cases on Thursday, bringing the total number of cases to 683 to date.  Under the Infectious Diseases (Measures to Prevent Spread of Covid-19) Regulations 2020, all sporting events, exhibitions, trade fairs, and public entertainment at cinemas, theatres, amusement or computer games centres, among other venues, are prohibited between Friday (March 27) and April 30, both dates inclusive.  Also banned during this period are enrichment activities or tuition for children 18 years of age and below at an enrichment or tuition centre or sporting facility, and the provision of goods, entertainment or services at bars, karaoke lounges, nightclubs or discotheques.  Those who contravene the new rules can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or face both penalties upon conviction.  Meanwhile, organisers of events that are not prohibited must not allow more than 10 people to be present or take part, unless these are conducted in the course of business at a workplace or an educational institution.

This will be done by issuing new shares to current shareholders to raise about $5.3 billion and issuing mandatory convertible bonds to raise up to $9.7 billion, the airline said on Thursday (March 26).  Temasek, which now owns about 55 per cent of the airline, has pledged to take up any remaining shares and bonds that are not subscribed.  The rights shares will be offered at $3 per share, a discount of about 54 per cent from the last traded price of $6.50 on Wednesday. The issue will be on the basis of three rights shares for every two existing shares held by shareholders.  The proposed convertible bond issue will be on the basis of 295 of these bonds for every 100 existing shares owned. The bonds, which come with zero coupon, will be priced at $1 each. If not redeemed before their maturity date in 10 years, the bonds will be converted to new shares based on a conversion price of $4.84 per share. This is a 10 per cent premium to the shares+ theoretical market price assuming the completion of the rights issue.  SIA had called for a rare trading halt on Thursday morning, pending an announcement.  In the meantime, SIA has arranged for a $4 billion bridge loan facility with DBS Bank.  SIA+s announcement came after Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat said in Parliament on Thursday that the airline was considering corporate action, supported by Temasek, amid the coronavirus outbreak.  +I welcome Temasek+s decision to lend support to SIA. SIA is an outstanding airline and a strategic asset for Singapore,+ Mr Heng told Parliament when he unveiled the Resilience Budget to provide a second round of measures to help firms and individuals affected by the outbreak.  +Through the Government+s support for the aviation sector, and if necessary more direct support measures, we will make sure that SIA is able to come through this in good shape.  +Ultimately, this is about preserving the status of our air hub so that it can emerge stronger from this crisis,+ he added.  The SIA Group sits at the heart of Singapore+s aviation system and anchors its position as an air hub, said Mr Heng.  Related Story Singapore Airlines expected to receive support from Temasek Holdings amid Covid-19 outbreak  He noted that SIA accounted for more than half of Changi Airport+s passenger traffic and cargo tonnage last year.  +As the main hub carrier, SIA links us to the rest of the world. Many foreign airlines choose to come to Changi because they can tap on SIA+s connectivity to the rest of the region,+ Mr Heng said.  +A diminished SIA will undermine our air hub+s ability to recover from the crisis. Air travel will eventually resume when Covid-19 comes under control. Until then, SIA will need liquidity to tide over this outbreak,+ the minister further added.  In this regard, SIA will benefit from the enhanced Jobs Support Scheme and the enhanced Aviation Support Package which will reduce its operating expenditure.  The airline had announced that it will slash its capacity as countries, including Singapore, tighten their borders.  It had this week cut 96 per cent of its scheduled capacity up to the end of next month.  The airline has also further cut the salaries of senior employees and looked into measures to reduce capital expenditure and operating costs.  Its low-cost unit Scoot has also suspended most of its network, resulting in the grounding of 47 out of its fleet of 49 aircraft.  Mr Shukor Yusof of Endau Analytics said: +It will definitely help shore up a fast depleting balance sheet and reassure investor and passenger confidence in SIA.  +More importantly, the amount to be raised shows the importance and value that the Singapore government puts in its flag carrier... this is the by far the biggest financial aid to an airline outside of the US.+","167":"SINGAPORE - Shopping malls and standalone stores must limit the number of shoppers on their premises and disperse groups of more than 10 people, said the authorities on Thursday (March 26).  Operators of malls and standalone stores such as Ikea and Courts Megastore must reduce operating capacity to avoid having more than one person per 16 sq m of usable space - roughly the size of an HDB flat bedroom - to minimise overcrowding, especially during peak periods.  These safe distancing measures take effect from 11.59pm on Thursday until April 30, as Singapore+s fight against Covid-19 enters a new phase amid a wave of imported cases to the country.  The Enterprise Singapore, Housing & Development Board, Singapore Tourism Board and Urban Redevelopment Authority issued a joint statement with a list of measures operators must adhere to.  The new rules would require mall operators to allow tenants to mark queue spots outside their units, spacing shoppers at least 1m from one another.  Tenants should also be allowed to extend temporary seating or queues beyond their premises to spread out the crowd where space permits, provided that fire escape routes and pedestrians are not obstructed.  Infant and children+s play areas or playgrounds, both indoors and outdoors, must be closed.  No events, open atrium sales, busking and live music performances, which are likely to cause shoppers to congregate, are allowed.

Other parents are scrambling to make alternative care arrangements for their pre-school-going children as all 360 PCF Sparkletots centres islandwide close for four days from Thursday (March 26).  PCF Sparkletots is the largest pre-school operator in Singapore, with over 40,000 children enrolled across its centres.  The closure of centres comes after PCF Sparkletots @ Fengshan Block 126 emerged on Wednesday as a new Covid-19 cluster, with 20 coronavirus cases linked to it so far. Fifteen cases are staff and five are their family members. The centre+s remaining 10 staff and about 110 students are now in quarantine.  Another 30 staff from other PCF centres have also been placed under quarantine as they had attended a training course with the Fengshan centre+s principal, who is a confirmed case.  Housewife Merry Chew, 34, and her daughter, two, who attends the Fengshan Block 126 branch, were served with quarantine orders on Thursday at their flat in Bedok. She has to be quarantined along with her daughter as she is her main caregiver, said Mrs Chew.  She said the centre had sent out an e-mail on Monday informing parents that a Nursery 2 teacher had tested positive for the coronavirus.  +The sent another e-mail to update us the next day that more staff had reported feeling unwell. They called us to make sure we were all aware about it.+  +The centre is doing its best to protect our kids. All of the teachers are really good,+ she said. +This is not their fault for sure.+  Mrs Chew said that she was worried by the large number of cases from the centre, but added that the coronavirus +is everywhere - you+re either lucky or unlucky+.  She has asked her mother-in-law to move in and help take care of her younger child, who is 10 months old.  In a letter to parents on Tuesday seen by The Straits Times, the centre said it would be closed for two weeks and reopen on April 8, unless otherwise advised by the Early Childhood Development Agency.  Parents from other PCF centres said they were informed of the centre closures only late on Wednesday night and had to rush to make last-minute care arrangements.  Ms Edwina Cheang, 25, who is a teacher in a private pre-school centre, has a daughter enrolled at a PCF Sparkletots centre in Buona Vista.  She said she got a call at 11pm on Wednesday, and had to apply for urgent leave on Thursday and Friday.  Sales assistant Sery Shida, 27, said her supervisor was able to find someone to cover her shifts over the next two days.  Said Mrs Shida, who has two sons who go to a Yishun PCF branch and one son in primary school: +But if there is prolonged closure, I+ll have to ask my mother-in-law for a helping hand. Honestly, it+s not easy to handle all of them. When I take my eldest son to school in the morning and pick him up in the afternoon, I have to take along the two younger ones.+  News of the other 30 staff across other PCF centres being quarantined also spooked some parents.  Mrs Jean Ong, 31, has a son attending PCF Sparkletots @ Fengshan Block 115, close to the affected centre. She said that when she first heard the news, she was not worried as it was a different centre from her son+s.  +But when I read the news about how 30 staff from other PCF centres have been placed under quarantine because they attended a training course with the Fengshan PCF centre+s principal, questions started to pop up in my head,+ said the sales executive.  Mrs Ong later received a call, on Thursday afternoon, from her son+s centre to inform her that its principal was one of the 30 employees who had been quarantined.  She said: +It had been a week since the two principals had contact. And our principal had been in school for the past week, and surely interacted with teachers.

Another parent, Ms Nurul Huda, 34, who has two children attending a PCF Sparkletots centre in Choa Chu Kang, also said she does not intend to let them go back to school +until there is a visible improvement in the figures+.  Said Ms Nurul, who is a private tutor: +No one knows how many people (the 30 quarantined staff) had interacted and had contact with.+  +It is a good measure to close all the centres,+ she said, but added that the four-day closure could be insufficient.  +The incubation period is 14 days. With only four days of closure, what happens if new cases emerge after the centres reopen?+  However, some parents are open to allowing their kids to go back to school on Monday, when the centres reopen.  A civil servant who has twins attending a PCF centre at Fengshan Block 184 said the four-day closure is necessary for PCF to +review their processes and take time to do another round of deep cleaning of the centres+.  The 33-year-old, who wanted to be called Ms Ye, said: +The school closure is troublesome and it was done very late - a lot of parents were scrambling - but I feel for the poor teachers who had to come back and call parents too.  +I will send my kids back to school (when centres reopen on Monday). I trust PCF+s processes and it+s just one centre which seems to have a lapse... we have to be brave and also hope that all partners have to be socially responsible.+","169":"SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - After planning for 18 months and spending more than $15,000, Ms Vivian Kwok has had to put her dream of a perfect wedding on hold indefinitely.  Her nuptials, which had been slated for April 5, which is also her birthday, can no longer go ahead as planned after the latest safe distancing measures to stem the spread of Covid-19.  +No one knows when things will improve. I am feeling a bit helpless, but I am trying to be positive,+ Ms Kwok, 26, told The New Paper on Wednesday (March 25).  +I am grateful my family has been supportive. We have been mentally preparing for this eventuality since January when the virus started spreading.+  Ms Kwok said that several guests were flying in from overseas, and friends in the medical sector had taken time off to attend the wedding.  +It has been a logistical challenge, with everyone having to adjust their schedules accordingly. Now we will have to do it all over again.+  Ms Kwok is thinking of going ahead with the customary portion of the wedding with just immediate family members and hopes to hold the wedding reception later this year, Covid-19 permitting.  Announced on Tuesday, the latest measures include the closure of bars, nightclubs and cinemas.  Social gatherings such as weddings are also restricted to not more than 10 people at any one time.  Wednesday saw a new high of 73 infections, with a spike in local cases to 35, of which 17 are linked to a new cluster at the PCF Sparkletots Pre-school at Fengshan Block 126.  Thirteen are staff from the pre-school and four are family members of the principal.

She was disappointed that the limit of 10 people meant she was allowed only five guests.  +This means only my family could join us. I am uncertain how to even feel about this,+ said the bride-to-be, who declined to be named.  +It is sad that we are unable to share our joy with people that we care about and want to celebrate with.+  OVERWHELMED  When she heard the news on Tuesday, she said she felt overwhelmed and had to scramble to sort out the arrangements.  A local wedding planning company, The Wedding Entourage, said all its events from now until end-April have been postponed.  Planning has also stopped for weddings scheduled for July to December, pending further developments.  Its spokesman said it would not charge clients for postponing their weddings as the situation is out of their control.  New dates are being suggested by the couples, with many of them concerned with having an auspicious date, the spokesman added.

So the florists are planning to either try to sell them or donate them, perhaps to hotels as they need fresh flower decorations every day.+  Hotels hosting wedding banquets have also had to make significant adjustments.  Mr Kieran Twomey, group chief operating officer at Millennium Hotels and Resorts, said: +We are happy to discuss creative solutions with clients on their events, such as video conferencing or splitting the group into two rooms to keep numbers small.  +Our sales teams have been reaching out to clients to offer options for postponement and rescheduling.+","170":"SINGAPORE - Rumours that the Government will raise the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) alert to Red, the highest level, are false.  +We are aware there has been false information purveyed on various platforms that we are going to declare Dorscon red, that the Government is going to go into a lockdown mode, that we are going to scale back the MRT and bus services,+ Communications and Information Minister S. Iswaran told reporters at Parliament on Thursday (March 26).  +All of this is completely untrue. We have issued clarification through the Gov.sg WhatsApp service. Such false information is completely irresponsible and it just serves to raise the level of anxiety and cause fear and panic in our population.+  There are four alert levels - green, yellow, orange and red - depending on the severity and spread of the disease. Each one contains advisories to the public and describes the impact on the community, including steps to be taken in daily life such as temperature screenings and border measures.  Singapore raised the alert level from Dorscon yellow to orange, the second-highest level, in February.  Mr Iswaran urged everyone to resist sharing false information, adding that there are legitimate sources of accurate, reliable and timely information such as the Health Ministry and Gov.sg websites.  +We hope that everyone will exercise prudence in sharing information, and verify the source and the truthfulness of it before they share it with their loved ones and friends,+ he said.  Singapore confirmed 73 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday (March 25) - the largest increase in a day, which brought the total number of cases here to 631.  Health Minister Gan Kim Yong on Wednesday told Parliament that the number of coronavirus cases will continue to rise in coming weeks as some of the 200,000 overseas Singaporeans return home.  Singapore announced its strictest measures to date in the fight against Covid-19 a day earlier, which included closing all entertainment outlets, limiting gatherings outside work and school to 10 people or fewer, and suspending all centre-based tuition and enrichment classes.

They will also not be able to claim from MediShield Life or Integrated Shield Plans for these treatments at public and private hospitals.  Earlier this month (March 12), Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had said in a televised national address that the Covid-19 situation in Singapore remains +under control+ and there are no plans to raise the disease outbreak response level alert to red.","171":"SINGAPORE - Patients who have acute respiratory symptoms and are issued a five-day sick leave by a medical practitioner must not leave their homes starting on the day the medical certificate is issued, according to the latest update of the Infectious Diseases Act made by the Ministry of Health (MOH).  Those who do not comply will be liable to a fine of up to $10,000 or up to a six-month imprisonment, or both. They can leave only to seek medical attention.  In February, doctors were advised to give five days of sick leave to patients with respiratory symptoms, such as fever, cough, sore throat and runny nose, in an effort to prevent further community spread of the coronavirus.  MOH urged people and employers to +follow strictly the five-day MC regime that has been put in place+.","172":"SINGAPORE - The Prime Minister, Cabinet ministers and other political office-holders - as well as the President - will take a three-month pay cut to stand in solidarity with Singaporeans in this difficult time, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Thursday (March 26).  Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, said that political office-holders will take an additional two-month pay cut on top of the one-month pay cut announced last month, in light of the deteriorating situation caused by the coronavirus.  +The President, Speaker and both Deputy Speakers have informed me that they will join in and take a similar three-month pay cut in total,+ said Mr Heng, as he delivered the Supplementary Budget.  +It is in times of crisis that the true character of a nation can be seen,+ he added. +We are all in this together, and we must all look after one another in these trying times.+  Calling the Covid-19 situation an +unprecedented crisis+ that has escalated very quickly, Mr Heng said it has prompted the Government to take extraordinary measures and put together a landmark supplementary budget.  Delivering a ministerial statement that outlined the Government+s thinking behind what he has called the Resilience Budget, Mr Heng said the coronavirus is a defining challenge for Singapore.  +It is a public health crisis, an economic shock, and a social test,+ he said. +It will challenge our resilience as individuals and as a society.+  Mr Heng noted that just five weeks after he delivered his Budget speech on Feb 18, the world is now facing a pandemic, with an estimated 410,000 people infected across 190 countries.  While Singapore acted early and decisively and managed to keep the number of cases to a manageable level during the first wave of infections, the world is now seeing successive waves and imported infections, prompting countries to take public health measures, said Mr Heng.  But measures on the medical front to contain the pandemic have made the economic battle more difficult, he added.  +As more countries implement their measures, the economic disruptions will be wider, deeper, and more prolonged,+ said Mr Heng. +The global economy is now facing both a supply and demand shock.+  He noted how lockdowns have had knock-on effects, given today+s highly-integrated global supply chains, while people staying home mean that spending has fallen, while business confidence is plunging in the face of growing uncertainties.  Global financial and stock markets are also in turmoil, while credit has tightened around the world, he added.  As an open economy that is highly integrated with the global economy, Singapore will be deeply impacted by these global shocks, said Mr Heng.  He noted that advance GDP estimates released on Thursday (March 26) showed that the economy contracted by 10.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2020, and the Ministry of Trade and Industry has downgraded the Republic+s GDP growth forecast for the year to between minus 4.0 per cent and minus 1.0 per cent.  +In economic terms alone, this will likely be the worst economic contraction since independence,+ said Mr Heng.  The Resilience Budget, which will introduce over $48 billion in new and enhanced measures, is therefore focused on three areas: protecting jobs, helping enterprises with immediate challenges, and strengthening economic and social resilience so that Singapore can emerge intact and stronger.  +We cannot prevent an economic recession as the external health and economic situation will evolve beyond our control,+ he said. +But it will help us to mitigate the extent of the downturn, and more importantly, help save jobs and protect livelihoods.+  The Resilience Budget is also a reminder that the battle against Covid-19 is waged not just on the medical and economic fronts, but that the virus is also a test of Singapore+s social cohesion and psychological resilience, said Mr Heng.  +This reflects our determination that Singapore and Singaporeans remain resilient in the face of these challenges,+ he said. +Come what may, no matter how daunting the challenge at hand, we will bounce back, stronger and more united than ever, as we weather this storm together.+  Concluding, Mr Heng pledged that the Government will lead the way in the fight against Covid-19 by doing its best to anticipate and respond to developments, make decisions based on facts and evidence, and exercise judgment when there are trade-offs.  +The Government and the political leadership are in this with Singaporeans,+ he said. +We share the worries and anxieties of Singaporeans, and we will do our best for them.  +We will walk with every Singaporean, through every up and down.+"},"caption":{"0":"+Malaysia+s lockdown will delay the supply of prefabricated pre-finished volumetric construction modules, and no construction project can continue without these materials.+","1":"+The 3 individuals had posted or shared links saying PAs and RCs were responsible for the Safra Jurong Chinese New Year function that led to Singapore+s largest coronavirus cluster.+","2":"+A sight not normally seen.+","3":"+An estimated 10,000 to 15,000 security officers, about one-third the workforce, are Malaysians who will be cut off from Singapore by the travel ban, said the president of the Security Association Singapore.+","4":"+It is estimated that more than 100,000 Malaysians, including some 1,000 nurses and healthcare workers, have no living arrangements in Singapore.+","5":"+Some hotels are offering accommodation to Malaysian staff, while others are allowing their employees to remain in Malaysia on paid leave.+","6":"+The suspension will last till at least April 15.
