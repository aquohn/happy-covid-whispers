But despite being warned not to cheat, a significant number allegedly shared their answers and plagiarised one another.  NUS is now scrutinising their submissions and identifying the alleged cheaters so action can be taken against them.  Replying to queries from The New Paper, a spokesman for the NUS School of Computing confirmed it is investigating, with instructors still making plagiarism checks and have yet to finalise the results.  +NUS takes a serious view of academic dishonesty and does not condone plagiarism,+ she said.  TNP understands Mr Prabawa Adi Yoga Sidi, the lecturer teaching the module, sent out an e-mail about a week ago urging students who had cheated to confess.  It is believed that several have come forward and admitted to plagiarism.  The exam is worth 15 per cent of the final grade for the programming methodology module, which is compulsory for engineering students.  The module, also known as CS1010E, is described as an introduction to fundamental concepts of problem solving, involving the use of computing and programming in the Python programming language.  The spokesman said about 680 students are taking the module in the current semester.  CLASS SETTING  The exam is usually held in a class setting, but in light of Covid-19, Mr Prabawa allowed it to be taken at home earlier this month.  Related Story NUS reminds students to declare travel plans after foreign exchange student expelled  Students had to log in at the same time to work independently on three tasks, comprising seven questions, and submit their answers online.  The spokesman said students were reminded that there would be plagiarism checks and penalties if they were caught.  According to NUS policies, students who plagiarise or aid and abet such actions may be subject to disciplinary action.  +In addition, the student may receive a reduced grade, possibly even a zero mark, for the relevant academic assignment, project or thesis, and could receive a failed grade for the module,+ said the spokesman.  +Any student caught plagiarising will be required to retain the plagiarised module as graded.+  Numerous posts on Facebook page NUSWhispers in the past week claimed to be from students taking the module.  Some claimed they had cheated because the conditions were difficult and it was to be expected, while others said they had learnt their lesson.  One post, addressed to Mr Prabawa, claimed that if disciplinary action was taken, it would be the school+s fault that +almost half+ of the students would be severely affected and face problems with graduation and finding jobs.  Another post said students were +begging for mercy+, as the plagiarism checks are +almost a death sentence+.  Related Story Interactive: How coronavirus is spreading across the world  Commenting on one of the posts, Mr Prabawa said the instructors were able to measure similarities in submissions and identify possible collaborations within groups, and this will be investigated further.  +Plagiarism is not a victimless crime. The students who are not plagiarising are being victimised. So we need to protect the victims,+ he said.  The spokesman said: +The school is aware of the diverse views raised by students.+  She said that instructors will address their concerns and plan to conduct optional remedial sessions to help those who had difficulties with the module.","19":"SINGAPORE - Schools and kindergartens will reopen next Monday (March 23) as planned, but with stricter measures to prevent the coronavirus being spread by those who had returned from trips abroad during the holidays.  Students and staff members of schools, pre-schools and student care centres will be given 14-day leave of absence if they returned from overseas on or after March 14.  The date of their return to Singapore will be taken as Day Zero of the 14 days.  The moves comes amid a recent spike in the number of imported cases. Eight out of 10 of Singapore\u2019s imported cases of Covid-19 have come in the last nine days.  The decision to reopen schools and pre-schools came amid speculation that the one-week school holidays which began on March 14 might be extended, especially after the number of new infections reached a new high of 47 on Wednesday.  Instead, additional precautionary measures will be put in place.  Students who will have to miss classes will be supported through home-based learning.  Parents will have to take their own leave should they need to care for their children on leave of absence but the ministries encouraged employers to provide flexible work arrangements.  Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said in a Facebook post on Thursday that \u201cthousands of our students and their families have travelled overseas and have returned, or are now making their way back\u201d.  \u201cOur priority must be to protect the education system and keeping students safe. By protecting the system robustly, it can remain open, and lives need not be disrupted. Otherwise, many parents, including those working in hospitals and providing essential services, will not be able to go to work.\u201d  Related Story All schools to be certified SG Clean by end-March  He acknowledged that students, parents and coaches may be inconvenienced by the decision.  He added: \u201cI hate to have to do this, but it is critical that we protect the system, and keep everyone who has overseas exposure to the virus away from the school population. Then we can possibly return to the calm we enjoyed before the March school holidays. We need to do our best to maintain that.\u201d  All co-curricular activities (CCAs) along with the National School Games will be suspended and the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation deferred, for two weeks.  Also for two weeks starting from Monday, pupils in Primary 3 and above will have \u201cfixed exam-style seating\u201d where they will sit further apart and in assigned seats and not move around, while Primary 1 and 2 pupils, as well as kindergarten children will have fixed group cluster seating.  Seating will also be assigned in canteens.  Classrooms and canteens will be routinely wiped down. During the March holidays, schools have been cleaned thoroughly.

Other precautions are also in place. Pre-schools continue with health checks and temperature screenings. Visitors are restricted from pre-schools, and parents are to drop off and pick up their children outside the school.  The stay-at-home order put in place by the ministry caught some parents like Madam L. Rosie, 43, by surprise. She had taken her two primary school going children to visit relatives in Malaysia.  \u201cMy husband and I were careful to drive straight to my parents\u2019 home in Johor .
