less likely to be sick from Covid-19 than adults, which is why there is no real reason to close schools for now, says Professor Dale Fisher, group director of medicine at the National University Health System and chair of the World Health Organisation+s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.  He shares more.  Q Why do children seem to be less affected by Covid-19 than adults?  A We know that there are other diseases where children are not affected as much. For instance, chicken pox is a much milder illness in children than in adults.  And a child with Hepatitis A (a viral liver disease) probably does not have symptoms, but they might have antibodies if you test them, whereas adults with Hepatitis A will develop fever and jaundice.  So, we know that children and adults have a different sort of immune system. The children could be - for reasons we do not yet understand - less likely to have symptoms.  If studies done to find out if children have antibodies to Covid-19 show that there are a lot of asymptomatic children, it will prove - but it will not tell us why - that children are getting infected but not showing symptoms.  Q Should we worry about children passing Covid-19 to the elderly?  A That is another question we do not yet know the answer to. However, if they are asymptomatic, they are less likely to do so.  In fact, a lot of the swabs that we have taken from family clusters have shown that while the parents might have had the disease and had symptoms, the children are completely well, even though they tested positive.  We have no evidence that the child in those family clusters was the first person to get it.  If you are asymptomatic, you are much less likely to spread it because you are not coughing, you are not making the droplets. Is it theoretically possible to spread it if you share a pair of chopsticks, for instance? We think it is probably theoretically possible, but it is certainly not a major driver of the outbreak. The money is on people with symptoms spreading the disease before they are diagnosed and isolated.  It is more the other way around - the parents have infected the child and the child is asymptomatic, but you can find (the virus) in their throat.  If you are asymptomatic, you are much less likely to spread it because you are not coughing, you are not making the droplets.  Is it theoretically possible to spread it if you share a pair of chopsticks, for instance?  We think it is probably theoretically possible, but it is certainly not a major driver of the outbreak.  The money is on people with symptoms spreading the disease before they are diagnosed and isolated.  So, if that period is a week, they are going to spread it a lot. If it is two days, they will not spread it so much.  If it is two days where they stayed home because they were not feeling well, then they will spread the disease to even fewer people, or to no one.  We know that younger people are unlikely to get serious illness, but they can be an important part of transmission and every young person in Singapore has parents and grandparents who are older.  Everyone needs to pull together to do their part, to help save lives.","5":"SINGAPORE - All short-term visitors will no longer be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore from 11.59pm on Monday (March 23) in view of the heightened risks of importing coronavirus cases into the country.  Work pass holders and their dependants will be allowed to return to Singapore only if they work in sectors that provide essential services such as healthcare and transport.  This will also kick in at 11.59pm on Monday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a statement on Sunday.  The measures were announced a day after two patients - a 75-year-old Singaporean woman and a 64-year-old Indonesian man - died from Covid-19 due to complications. They were the first deaths the Republic has seen in the Covid-19 outbreak.  National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said at a briefing on Sunday morning that the measures to +significantly tighten+ Singapore+s borders are taken in the light of the rapidly escalating virus outbreak around the world.  Previously, except for a handful of countries, short-term visitors from elsewhere were allowed to come into Singapore but were issued a 14-day stay-home notice (SHN) upon arrival.  This meant, however, that resources were being expended to serve and enforce SHNs on them, and if they fell ill, to provide them with medical treatment. On Saturday, there were still 533 short-term visitors arriving in Singapore.  To date, there are more than 260,000 Covid-19 cases across 185 countries, and around 11,200 deaths.  The MOH said that in Singapore, almost 80 per cent of new Covid-19 cases over the past three days were imported, most of them Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning home from abroad.  These imported cases had travel histories to 22 different countries.  There were 432 cases of coronavirus patients in Singapore as of Saturday evening. A total of 140 cases have fully recovered. Of the 290 patients still in hospital, most are stable or improving, but 14 are in critical care.  On the limited entry for work pass holders and their dependants, the Manpower Ministry will allow this only for those in essential services.  On what constitutes essential services, Mr Wong said the Ministry of Manpower will continue to approve applications for the workers to come back according to existing rules, with inputs from relevant government agencies when needed.  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore residents who travel overseas may face consequences as Govt ramps up border controls  He added that foreign domestic helpers could also be considered as offering essential services, especially in cases where they are needed to help look after children or the elderly.  As previously announced, all Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders returning will continue to be issued a 14-day SHN.  In addition, Malaysians with Singapore work permits can continue to work in the Republic during this period, with accommodation arrangements.  Transport of goods between both countries will also be facilitated, the Singapore-Malaysia Special Working Committee has agreed.  Diplomats accredited and based in Singapore can continue to come in. They will also be subjected to the 14-day isolation.  On Sunday, Mr Wong said that these were very significant moves especially for a small open economy like Singapore which has always been connected to the world.  +But this is an unprecedented crisis,+ he said.  He noted that while very few short-term visitors have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, they can take up enforcement and medical resources.  +During this time, we have to focus our resources on returning Singaporeans,+ he said.  On how long these measure will remain in place, he said: +I can+t say at this stage. No one will know how long this current wave of imported cases we are experiencing will last for.+  He added: +It depends on how long the outbreak is going to continue in Europe and America, which are now the new epicentres for the virus outbreak. It (also) depends on how long more we will see returning Singaporeans coming back, so we will monitor on a day by day basis.+  Mr Wong also warned that the Government is considering measures against those who choose to travel overseas despite the border control measures.  +I don+t think we can allow this to continue. We are discussing what additional measures may be needed,+ he said, adding that work pass holders who leave Singapore at this time may face the consequence of not being allowed entry later.  In recent days, most of the new patients in Singapore have been imported cases, that is, returning residents and long-term pass holders with travel history to Europe, North America, South-east Asia and other parts of Asia.  Besides strict border controls, rigorous contact tracing, quarantine and home isolation, the Government has implemented safe distancing measures such as smaller crowd sizes and keeping safe spaces around individuals, especially vulnerable segments of the population like the elderly.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  For example, all events and gatherings with 250 or more participants are to be suspended until June 30, while the suspension of all social activities for seniors by government agencies will be extended for another two weeks until April 7.  In a Facebook post after the two deaths were announced on Saturday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong sent his deepest condolences to the patients+ loved ones. He said Singapore must brace itself for more losses even as healthcare workers do their best to care for patients.  He also urged everyone to work together with the Government in its efforts to slow the spread of the virus.","6":"SINGAPORE - The World Health Organisation director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus dispensed advice on how people can look after their health at a media briefing on Friday (March 20).  He said this will not only help people in the long-term, but it will also help the fight Covid-19 if they get it.  In his opening remarks at the briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, he included the following health tips:  First, eat a health and nutritious diet, which helps your immune system to function properly.  Second, limit your alcohol consumption, and avoid sugary drinks.  Third, do not smoke, he said, as smoking damages your lungs and can increase your risk of developing severe disease if you become infected with Covid-19.  Fourth, exercise. WHO recommends 30 minutes of physical activity a day for adults, and one hour a day for children.  If allowed, go outside for a walk or a run, while keeping a safe distance from others.  If you cannot leave the house, find an exercise video online, dance to music, do some yoga, or walk up and down the stairs.

Talking to people you know and trust can help.  +Supporting other people in your community can help you as much as it does them. Check in on neighbours, family and friends. Compassion is a medicine,+ said Dr Tedros.  +Listen to music, read a book or play a game. And try not to read or watch too much news if it makes you anxious. Get your information from reliable sources once or twice a day.+  In the same set of remarks, Dr Tedros said: +One of the things we are learning is that although older people are the hardest hit, younger people are not spared.  +Data from many countries clearly show that people under 50 make up a significant proportion of patients requiring hospitalisation.+  At the start of last week, he had warned that although the evidence they have suggests that those over 60 are at highest risk, young people, including children, have died.","12":"SINGAPORE - The 75 year-old Singaporean woman who became the first patient to die of Covid-19 was linked to the cluster at The Life Church and Missions Singapore.  Known as Case 90, she had no recent travel history to China, a Health Ministry statement on Feb 24 had said.  She had reported the onset of symptoms on Feb 9 and sought treatment at a general practitioner+s clinic that day, as well as on Feb 17 and Feb 23.  She was taken in an ambulance to the emergency department of Tan Tock Seng Hospital on Feb 23 and immediately isolated.  Subsequent test results confirmed Covid-19 infection that afternoon. She was warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases and died at 7.52am on Saturday (March 21).  A statement said she had a history of chronic heart disease and hypertension.  In a statement by her church, it said it had received the news of her death.  \u201cAs this is one of the first Covid-19 deaths in Singapore, we are not sure what can or cannot be done with regard to the funeral arrangements,\u201d her church said.  \u201cHer family would make the final decision on the funeral details, as besides our church, her family member attending another church may also seek the assistance of their own church to plan the funeral.\u201d  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Prior to being admitted to hospital, she had kept mostly to her home in Bishan Street 12, a ministry statement had said earlier.  The woman is linked to the second largest virus cluster in Singapore, with 33 patients and which comprises two church sub-clusters.  One of them, the Grace Assembly of God church, has 23 patients, including the church+s senior pastor.  The Life Church and Missions Singapore, which the 75-year-old woman was linked to, has 10 patients. This church is in Paya Lebar.","16":"SINGAPORE - Restaurant owners closed tables, while retailers spaced out customers queueing up as they geared up on Friday (March 20) for new safe distancing requirements.  The Ministry of Health had announced measures to reduce the risk of local transmission of the coronavirus, including requiring public venues like eateries, shops and cinemas to keep patrons at least 1m apart.  Though the measures were to be rolled out progressively from Saturday, preparations had already begun at several businesses.  Casual restaurant chain Collin+s has already moved out around 10 per cent of its tables in its Nex shopping mall outlet to ensure adequate spacing between groups of diners.  Mr Jonathan Lim, 48, chief development officer at SF Group, Collin+s parent company, said: +It+s a bit of a sacrifice and dine-in business has been impacted slightly. But we try to cope by having more offers to draw customers to dine during off-peak hours.+  Chinese restaurant Soup Restaurant managing director Wong Wei Teck, 64, similarly said it started implementing the 1m safety distance and collecting diners+ details for contact tracing at two of its 15 outlets. It intends to implement the measures at all outlets by the end of next week.  +We+re a family restaurant and we frequently get big groups. It can be little bit troublesome for customers but it+s safety first,+ said Mr Wong.  Meanwhile, Koi operations project manager Lim Zhi Liang, 34, said that at outlets with self-order touchscreen kiosks, staff will space them at least 1m apart and disinfect the touchscreens every 15 to 30 minutes. Floor markers will be rolled out across all 57 outlets over the next few days.  Over at Zouk in Clarke Quay, the nightspot is limiting the capacity in each of its four venues - Zouk main room, Capital, Phuture and Redtail - to 250 people each, including staff. Guest information will also be collected for contact tracing.  Mr Seah Kian Peng, group chief executive of FairPrice Group, said that 1m floor markers at the checkout counters and storewide announcements every 30 minutes to remind customers to space themselves would be progressively implemented at all 148 FairPrice outlets. He said, however, that there are no plans at the moment to limit the number of shoppers in stores.  NEA and town councils are also in the process of marking out seats at hawker centres to guide patrons on how to practise safe distancing.  To help businesses comply with the new requirements, Enterprise Singapore, the National Environment Agency, the Singapore Food Agency and the Singapore Tourism Board issued two joint advisories on Friday with steps the firms can take.  For instance, it said retail shops may use floor markers, along with clear signage, to indicate queuing positions for fitting rooms and at cashiers.  Shops may also limit the number of people within the store and let shoppers in progressively though supermarkets are advised not to create queues outside their stores.  Food and beverage establishments were advised to reduce queues outside their outlets by taking down diners+ details and calling them when seats are available. If not possible, the 1m floor markers, with clear signage, should be used to manage the crowd.    A staff at Koi at Nex in Serangoon places a customer+s order on a designated area on the counter on March 20, 2020. ST PHOTO: NG SOR LUAN    The advisories also encouraged the use of self-checkout counters, cashless payments and mobile ordering to both speed up payment and prevent crowding at cashiers and pick-up points.  Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Chee Hong Tat, who on Friday visited some businesses in Nex mall in Serangoon that were putting safe-distancing precautions in place, said the effectiveness of the measures requires the cooperation of everyone.  +The (floor) markers may be there but the public must also get used to making some of these adjustments,+ said Mr Chee.  Most of the shoppers The Straits Times spoke to welcomed the moves.

It was helter-skelter after Malaysia announced a two-week national lockdown on Monday night. The disorder was not just over there but also in Singapore because of the close ties between the two countries.  Students and workers scrambled across the Causeway to beat the lockdown deadline as employers here sought lodgings for their workers.  Like China and Italy, Malaysia has taken drastic action to counter a surge in coronavirus cases, mostly linked to a mass religious event in late February.  When asked if Singapore would consider such a move, which is also in place in France and being considered in London, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong told a press conference on Tuesday that while he could not rule it out, it was not on the cards.  Observers and public health experts say the chaos that ensued after Malaysia+s lockdown showed why such a measure would be warranted only if the outbreak gets out of hand and the benefits outweigh the costs.  Dr Gillian Koh, deputy director for research at the Institute of Policy Studies, told The New Paper: +Singapore+s survival and sustainability depends on borders being open and receiving goods as well as people.  +So the cost of locking down Singapore is very high, both for the economy and for sustaining daily life itself.+  But a recent spike in the number of infections has led to online ire and frustration over people here going on holidays despite advisories to defer non-essential travel.  A record 47 new cases were reported on Wednesday, of which 30 were Singapore residents returning from abroad.  Yesterday, for the first time in five days, the number of new cases dropped, as 32 infections were confirmed, of which 24 were imported, all involving returning Singapore residents.  Arguing why a lockdown was highly unlikely, Dr Koh said: +Even with returning Singaporeans, we have very stringent protocols and all of us do expect them to abide by them... to ensure that we keep the extreme scenario of a lockdown as far away as possible.+  National University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser said it was understandable that Singaporeans felt negatively towards people they deemed socially irresponsible.  Singapore Management University law don Eugene Tan agreed but felt these sentiments would weaken after the outbreak.  Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, infectious diseases programme leader at Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at NUS, said a lockdown is a +nuclear option+ reserved for when community transmission has to be brought under control quickly.  While this seems to have worked for China, which yesterday saw zero new infections in Hubei province for the first time since the virus emerged there, Prof Hsu said lockdowns cannot be done indefinitely.  With the virus spreading in so many countries, it could also still be re-imported.  Whether an outbreak is severe enough to warrant such an extreme measure depends on how much each society can tolerate its costs, said Prof Hsu.  +Sometimes that price is far higher than what the virus can do,+ he added.  TESTING CAPACITY  Making a comparison with South Korea+s approach, which involved expanding its testing capacity rapidly and implementing strict social distancing, Prof Hsu said each country had to find the right balance and use its strengths where possible to control the outbreak.  +We are fortunate that community transmission is low at present, and there is more leeway in terms of what we can do,+ he added.  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore General Hospital to convert part of carpark into fever screening area  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam said it is thanks to the hard work put in earlier during the outbreak that a lockdown is not needed here.  Prof Hsu said what Singapore is doing now is to try to prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed at its current capacity, or what is known as flattening the curve.  But at the same time, he said Singapore can also prepare for a possible surge and try to expand healthcare capacity.  He suggested training people to take over some of the work done by nurses so they can be freed up for other tasks.  +For the regular patients... they can just be isolated in a facility where they can+t transmit the virus but can be monitored and taken care of in a way that doesn+t require the heavy resources of a hospital bed or an isolation room,+ Prof Hsu said.  Dr Leong was optimistic that Singapore could maintain its efforts in fighting the virus over the next three to six months but warned against complacency.  Reminding the public to stay home if unwell and urging them to defer travel plans, he said: +We have all the necessary ingredients to overcome this outbreak. But all this is hanging precariously. If we are not careful, it can be lost at the drop of a hat.+  LISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST","25":"SINGAPORE - Malaysians with Singapore work permits can continue to work in Singapore with health screening and accommodation arrangements made for them, while food and products will continue to be transported across the border smoothly.

The two Senior Ministers discussed the arrangements to ensure the health of the citizens on both sides of the border, while minimising disruptions to companies, workers and citizens.

Employers who place their staff on this voluntary LOA will be able to claim daily support under a programme by the MOM aimed at alleviating the companies+ financial burden during the Covid-19 outbreak.  This initiative follows recent, stricter measures imposed by schools to curb the spread of the coronavirus, after more infections and a surge in imported cases were recorded in Singapore.  All students and staff who returned from overseas between last Saturday (March 14) and this Friday will be put on a mandatory 14-day leave of absence from the date of return.  From 11.59pm on Friday, all arriving travellers, including Singaporeans, will face even more stringent measures and will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice.  This means they will not be able to leave their homes for 14 days.  In encouraging companies to voluntarily impose the LOA on Friday, the MOM said: +The Government recognises that many parents have been affected by this national measure due to the need to provide care for their children during this period.  +At the same time, it is a useful precautionary measure for people who have travelled recently to stay away from the workplace to prevent further transmission.+  The MOM said companies should adopt flexible work arrangements to allow these employees to work from home during that whole 14-day period.  It noted that some companies had already voluntarily asked employees to stay home after returning from trips overseas between last Saturday and Friday.  Such companies should continue with existing flexible work and leave arrangements, including asking their employees to use their annual leave to cover the company imposed LOA, said the MOM.  However, for those companies that have not put such measures in place, +employers are encouraged to provide additional paid leave to the employees, if work from home is not feasible+, considering that the LOA option was not known before their employees travelled.  To help these companies, the MOM will allow them to apply for the $100 daily support under the LOA support programme, which covers only employees who are Singaporeans, permanent residents or work pass holders.  Companies can also claim a levy waiver for their affected work pass holders.  Those who are self-employed and who have to put themselves on LOA will similarly be allowed to claim this daily support.  Eligible employers will be able to apply for daily support for each affected employee after their LOA is completed.  However, employers, self-employed Singaporeans and permanent residents will not be able to claim under the support programme if they worked remotely during the LOA period or if the affected employee had to use his or her own annual leave, childcare leave or any other kind of leave to cover the LOA.  Additionally, those who have been placed on stay-home notice upon returning to Singapore and whose travel was not between March 14 to 20 are not eligible for daily support under this programme.  Said the MOM: +As the Covid-19 situation continues to evolve, there may be additional requirements imposed on work pass holders from time to time.+  It urged employers and employees to check the MOM website for the latest advisories.

The Anglican Diocese of Singapore said on Thursday (March 19) that this was with immediate effect to +create a two-week break in church gatherings+.  +The Diocesan leadership has closely monitored the escalating Covid-19 situation and makes this contribution towards the concerted national effort to +flatten the coronavirus curve+,+ it said, referring to the graph that shows a lower number of infected cases over time with proper containment measures.  There are currently 27 parishes of varying sizes in the Anglican Diocese of Singapore, with an average weekly attendance of about 21,000.  The churches plan to be open before the weekend of April 4 and 5, the start of Holy Week, which is the week leading up to Easter Sunday on April 12.  In the meantime, online weekend services will be conducted, and pastoral care will given to the elderly and the vulnerable.  The announcement comes after St Andrew+s Cathedral, the oldest Anglican site of worship in Singapore, was closed after one of its members was infected with the coronavirus.  On Wednesday, a notice was put up informing members that the church, located next to City Hall, would be closed from 11.59pm on Wednesday to 11.59pm on April 3 for the affected premises to be professionally disinfected.  It said that it received the information about the case on Wednesday afternoon, and the infected member is currently warded in hospital.

Among them, 33 were imported and 30 involved Singapore residents returning from abroad. This brought the total number of cases here to 313.  In light of these recent developments, it is vital that people mind their health, and take the necessary precautions should they feel unwell.  Q: What are the symptoms for Covid-19?  The two most common symptoms for Covid-19 are fever (of 37.8 deg C and above) and cough.  Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam said that those who are experiencing either of the two symptoms, or both, should consult a doctor.  He also added that those who feel generally unwell should also see a doctor, noting that practically all the identified Covid-19 cases had the sensation of being unwell at some point.  Q: What about mild, flu-like symptoms which are not fever and cough? Should I visit the doctor as well?  Other mild, flu-like symptoms such as sore throat, stuffy nose and runny nose should be monitored closely for at least five days, said Dr Leong, as sore throat and stuffy nose were not symptoms present in 90 per cent of the confirmed Covid-19 cases.  However, people should look out for any prolonged or worsening symptoms, as well as new, developing symptoms, he noted, and see a doctor if these occur.  In the meantime, individuals should practise self-quarantine measures at home and avoid going out, as there is a chance they could be incubating the virus.  Q: Can I self-medicate at home if I+m facing any of the above symptoms?  You may self-medicate if you are facing mild symptoms. However, you should visit a doctor if the symptoms are prolonged or worsening.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  If you are having a cough or fever, which are common Covid-19 symptoms, you should definitely visit a doctor.  On whether people suffering from Covid-19 symptoms should avoid taking ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug meant for fever and pain, Dr Leong said that it has not yet been clinically proven that the drug predisposes the body to more infections.  But he suggests they choose alternatives such as paracetamol, synflex or voltaren as a precautionary measure.  Q: Should I visit the doctor if I+m experiencing breathlessness?  Yes, although breathlessness does not usually develop until the later stages of Covid-19. By then, individuals would have experienced other accompanying symptoms as well, noted Dr Leong.  Dr Piotr Chlebicki, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Alvernia Hospital, also shared the same advice, adding that breathlessness is cause for medical attention, as the individual could be facing other complications like heart disease or asthma.  Q: What if I am asymptomatic so far, but I don+t feel very well in general, should I still see the doctor?  Yes, as long as you are feeling unwell, or sense that something is out of the ordinary, it would be a good idea to visit the doctor.  Dr Chlebicki also suggested that it would be good practice to call in to clinics before going, as this could help reduce overcrowding.  In addition, you should also refrain from doctor-hopping, said MOH in an advisory on March 11, as going back to the same doctor could ensure follow-up, and that you+re sent for Covid-19 testing if necessary.","37":"SINGAPORE - New developments for the Covid-19 situation have been coming thick and fast over the past few days, with Malaysia deciding to impose a lockdown and fresh travel restrictions being put in place by Singapore.

The move, which will take effect from 11.59pm on Friday (March 20), was among new measures announced to contain the spread of coronavirus cases. To date, Singapore has reported a total of 313 cases.  Here+s what you need to know about SHN, based on the Ministry of Health advisory:  1. Am I under quarantine orders if I am on SHN?  No, you are not under quarantine orders and are not required to have a dedicated room and toilet if this is not feasible. However, you should remain in your place of residence at all times during the 14-day period.  2. What is the difference between leave of absence and SHN?  People taking leave of absence are allowed to leave their place of residence to purchase daily necessities or to attend to important personal matters.  Those issued a SHN should remain in their place of residence at all times during the 14-day period.  3. Can my family members continue to stay with me during this time? Are they at risk of infection?  Your family members may continue to live with you. However, you and your family should observe good personal hygiene practices. If you become unwell, avoid contact with your family members and seek medical attention immediately.  4. My family members\/flatmates\/tenants have just returned from one of the affected areas. Can I still carry on with my daily activities, such as going to work or school?  Yes, the SHN applies only to persons returning from affected areas listed in the advisory (NOTE: From Friday, March 20, at 11.59pm, the SHN will be extended to all people arriving from overseas). Nonetheless, you should continue to monitor your health, observe good personal hygiene and seek medical attention if unwell.  5. Do I need to declare to my employers\/schools that I am on SHN?  Those who have returned from the affected areas are advised to inform their employers or schools that they are on SHN. This is so that your employer or school can provide the necessary assistance to facilitate your SHN.  6. If I am delivering food\/supplies to a person under SHN, should I wear a mask or other protective equipment to protect myself?  There is no need for masks or other protective equipment. The delivery can be conducted in such a way as to minimise contact with the person under SHN. The SHN is a precautionary measure and persons under SHN are not close contacts of confirmed cases.  7. Can I send my employees\/students to the doctor to get tested at the end of the 14-day period so that they can be cleared to come back to work\/return to school?  It is not useful to send persons who do not have symptoms to the doctor\/hospital for testing. Such individuals will not be offered diagnostic testing, and will be asked to return home.  8. What if I do not comply with the SHN?  If you fail to comply with the SHN, you may face the following penalties, as you have put the well-being of the wider community at risk:  a. You may be prosecuted under Section 21A of the Infectious Diseases Act.  b. If you are a Singapore permanent resident, long-term-visit pass holder, dependant+s pass holder, or student+s pass holder, your re-entry permit or passes may be revoked or the validity shortened.  c.

For life-threatening cases such as cardiac arrest, active seizures, breathlessness, major traumas and stroke, please call 995 directly for assistance.  For non-emergencies (such as cough or fever, follow-up visits for chronic conditions, refilling of prescription, etc):  a.

Please inform the staff and doctor of your travel history and that you have been issued an SHN.  b. For students\/pre-school students, you can seek assistance from your school or MOE\/ECDA.  c. For foreign employees issued with a work pass, you should contact your employer.  10. If I am worried about my status (whether or not I am infected), can I go to a hospital or the National Centre for Infectious Diseases to get tested?  Diagnostic testing is available for symptomatic individuals who are admitted to hospital on suspicion of infection. If you develop a fever, cough or breathlessness, or are feeling unwell, you should seek medical attention. Your doctor will assess and refer you to the hospital if necessary.

The steps include encouraging riders to take their temperatures and letting them drop off food without having physical contact with customers.  From Tuesday (March 17), Deliveroo customers will be able to opt to pick up their food orders from a thermal bag placed on the floor while the delivery rider waits at least 1m away.  And people ordering via GrabFood can alert Grab via its feedback channels of any food delivery rider who seems unwell. Riders can do the same if they encounter customers who appear ill.  Anyone who is repeatedly flagged as showing respiratory syndromes will be asked to see a doctor and get medical clearance before they can continue using the GrabFood platform.  Many of these measures were already in place before a GrabFood rider - believed to be the first case of an infected food delivery rider here - was confirmed with Covid-19 on Friday (March 13).

In addition, its riders must wash or sanitise their hands before and after shifts and have been asked to sterilise their delivery bags at least twice a day to prevent any contamination in the delivery process.  Grab and Deliveroo will provide financial support for riders who are infected by the coronavirus or have to be isolated as a precautionary measure.  Labour MP Ang Hin Kee said such financial support would help to discourage unwell people from working.

I would urge that, by demonstrating such concerns, more will use their platforms.+","91":"SINGAPORE - All foreign domestic workers entering Singapore will be served a 14-day stay-home notice, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Sunday (March 15).  All employers and employment agencies planning for their foreign domestic workers to enter Singapore will also need to obtain the MOM+s approval before the workers commence their journey.  These measures, taken in view of the rapid spread of Covid-19 worldwide, would affect both new and returning workers.  They would take effect from 11.59pm on Monday.  +The new measures take into consideration that FDWs live with families and many look after young children and the elderly,+ said the MOM.  It said all new incoming foreign domestic workers must serve their stay-home notices at an alternative accommodation (dormitories, hostels or hotels) before they can be deployed for employment.  For domestic workers returning from overseas, their employers can arrange for them to serve the notice in the employer+s residential address, or alternative accommodation.  On the entry approval for the domestic workers, the MOM said the application can be done online.  The applicant - either the employer or the employment agency - will be responsible for ensuring that the domestic worker complies with the stay-home notice.  They also have to ensure that the worker has access to a local mobile phone and remains contactable by the MOM during the 14-day period.  The ministry said that employers and agencies should ask the domestic worker not to make travel plans until approval is obtained.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  +The employment agencies or employers will be required to send the MOM approval letter to the FDWs, who will need to show it to the airline staff during check-in and at the ICA checkpoint upon arrival in Singapore,+ said the MOM.  It also said that it is the collective responsibility of all involved to ensure that the new requirements are complied with.  +Enforcement action, including revocation of work passes and suspension of work pass privileges, will be taken if the requirements are not complied with,+ the MOM added.  +Demerit points will also be imposed on agencies whose actions result in violation of the requirements by the FDWs.+  Employers of domestic workers who do not serve their stay-home notices at the employer+s registered residential addresses can apply to tap a support package from the MOM.  This package will allow eligible employers who are Singapore citizens or permanent residents to get $60 support daily per affected domestic worker and have their levy waived during the stay-home notice period.  More details on the application process will be made known at a later stage.  The MOM said: +Prospective employers should factor in the new requirements, including cost implications, in their hiring decisions.  +They should also consider renewing their existing FDW+s contract or hire a transfer FDW instead.+  Related Story Coronavirus: Singaporeans out in force over the weekend despite social distancing measures  It also strongly encouraged domestic workers to spend their rest day at home, and urged employers to work out the appropriate arrangements to facilitate this.  The MOM added that employers should work with foreign domestic workers to come to a mutual agreement for workers to postpone plans, if any, to travel back home until the coronavirus outbreak stabilises.","92":"SINGAPORE - Singaporeans and Malaysians travelling into Singapore from Malaysia via sea or land will be exempted from the new border restrictions on Asean countries, due to the close proximity and high inter-dependency between the two neighbours.  But separate arrangements for precautions are being worked out by a bilateral joint working group, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said on Sunday (March 15).  The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Sunday announced that from 11.59pm on Monday, all travellers - including Singapore citizens, permanent residents, long-term pass holders, and short-term visitors - entering Singapore with recent travel history to Asean countries, Japan, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom within the last 14 days will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice (SHN).  But Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the coronavirus outbreak, said such restrictions on those coming in from Malaysia would be complex.  He noted that 300,000 people move across the land crossings at the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints alone on a daily basis.  +We do have to put in place some special considerations for Malaysia because of the close proximity and the high inter-dependency between our two countries,+ said Mr Wong.  +So for now, the arrangements which I just described will not apply to our sea and land crossings with Malaysia.+  Malaysia reported 190 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, with most linked to a religious event at a mosque that was attended by more than 10,000 people from several countries.  The new cases bring the total number of infections in the country to 428.  Mr Wong added: +We do need precautions to be taken at these checkpoints, but it is going to be more complex, given the high volume of people moving in and out of these checkpoints.  +We want precautions to be taken there, and so separate arrangements are being worked out by the bilateral joint working group we have with Malaysia.+","100":"SINGAPORE - What does clearing your tray have to do with fighting the coronavirus? And has the Covid-19 outbreak helped in fighting climate change?  The Straits Times sat down with four experts - Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli, Public Hygiene Council chairman Edward D+Silva, the director of the National Environment Agency+s (NEA) department of public cleanliness, Mr Tai Ji Choong, and director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Wang Linfa - to find out more.  Q: What does tray return have to do with my health?  Professor Wang: Infectious materials are living organisms that thrive on food. The longer you leave contaminants on the table, the higher the chances of someone coming in contact with them.  Q: What is one of the worst hygiene habits people here have?  Mr Masagos: Until recently, even myself, after I eat in a hawker centre, I will put my tissue paper inside (my bowl) and I think that+s not littering, it+s just keeping it away from the floor and so forth. But I+m beginning to recognise that these are also what I call little biohazards that you leave on the table sometimes, or even in your bowl.  Eat on a tray so that if the food falls out of your bowl, it falls on the tray, and then when you return the tray, the table is clean for the next person. At the same time, the cleaners do not have to clean up after you.  Q: Is +I cannot find a bin+ a valid excuse for littering?  Mr Tai: Well, just counting the public bins that are owned by NEA, we already have over 11,000 bins - and this doesn+t include the town council bins.  The shopping malls have their own bins. The MRT stations have their own bins. So actually Singapore has no shortage of bins. And the bins are actually within very easy reach.  So there are really no reasons for a person to say +I cannot find a bin, so I just drop (my litter).+  Related Story Keeping clean the first line of defence against coronavirus: Expert panel  Q: What changes are being made to Singapore+s hawker centres to encourage cleaner practices?  Mr D+Silva: We realise that when customers finish their food, if you want them to clear their trays, the tray return facility should be as close as possible to them so that they don+t have to walk a long way. These are just behavioural patterns. So I think this is something which we can learn and we can improve.  The cleaning operators will have to also upskill themselves, and we need to see how we can help them mechanise to some extent, and at the same time educate and promote awareness among their own cleaners... (Cleaners) can do a much better, efficient job if they are doing things other than just clearing your trays. So I think these are little things that we can tweak in the months ahead.  Q: How do cleaning agents and disinfectants help fight the virus?  Prof Wang: The virus has a lipid membrane outside, and for the virus to remain intact, it needs to maintain the lipid.  Many of the cleaning agents can dissolve this lipid, so that+s why it+s very important that we wash our hands either with soap or a sanitiser or 70 per cent ethanol. All of these will not only clean the environment in the general sort of sense but, more specifically for Covid-19, you can actually disrupt the virus and then prevent its transmission.  Q: Can Covid-19 help lower global emissions and fight climate change?  Mr Masagos: Even if there is a positive impact on climate change, the cost to lives is huge, and I don+t think we should be celebrating this.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Related Story Five lessons from fighting Covid-19  Related Story Drill into what makes people socially responsible  We have set the world on this journey of reducing emissions and then getting ready to adapt.

R0 refers to the basic reproduction number. It indicates the natural spread of the virus, said Professor Wang, who is director of the programme in emerging infectious diseases at Duke-NUS Medical School.  If R0 is less than one, it means each existing infection causes fewer than one new infection. In this case, the disease will decline and eventually die out, but if it is greater than one, it will probably keep spreading.  Countries, including Singapore, are taking measures to drive R0 to less than one, said Prof Want.  +I think so far we+re doing pretty good, but I think we need to really keep it up,+ he said, adding that everyone, from the individual to the Government, could help to draw down R0 for Covid-19.  Prof Wang said the R0 for Covid-19 is estimated to be between two and three, similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). In comparison, the R0 for measles is about 12.  Prof Wang said bringing R0 down would also help to +flatten the epidemic curve+ by preventing the number of infected cases from surging suddenly.  The epidemic curve is an n-shaped curve that is used to visualise when new cases happen and at what speed during a virus outbreak.  Said Prof Wang: +If you let the natural R0 play out, the hospitals will collapse because there+s not enough beds, not enough ventilators. So the strategy is to flatten the curve so that, for example, you have severe cases of 10 per day rather than a hundred or a thousand per day.+  Prof Wang was one of four panellists who took part in Monday+s discussion.  The other three included Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli, who is head of the new SG Clean task force; Mr Edward D+Silva, chairman of the Public Hygiene Council; and Mr Tai Ji Choong, director of the National Environment Agency+s Department of Public Cleanliness.  While other measures - such as adhering to social distancing recommendations and staying home if one feels ill - are important, Mr Masagos said that it was also important for people to practise good cleanliness habits.  Related Story Keeping clean the first line of defence against coronavirus: Expert panel  +Public hygiene, personal hygiene is our first defence. And it+s not just our defence against Covid-19 today, but against other breakouts that we cannot foresee in future,+ he said.  Asked if travelling on public transport was safe, given the recent recommendations for people to keep their distance from others, Mr Masagos said the risk of exposure depended on a number of factors, including duration and intensity of exposure, and the density of the crowd.  Huge crowds, such as the religious gathering at a mosque in Malaysia, was one example of high-density situations that should be avoided, said Mr Masagos, who is also Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs.  +The other is intensity - how close are you to the person, how much you+re interacting with the person,+ he said, citing the cluster of Covid-19 patients who were linked to a dinner event at Safra Jurong.  Contact-tracing efforts had found that the patients linked to the event had also spent time together outside the dinner, including going for karaoke sessions together.  Duration of exposure is also important, said Mr Masagos, adding that the rough guideline is to keep exposure to under about 30 minutes.  Said Mr Masagos: +Therefore, if in any social setting, if you can ensure that you have short duration, you have low intensity and you have low density, then you are safer than not.+  Prof Wang added that in such an outbreak, there is no fail-safe measure and that there is a risk of exposure in any closed environment, including in an elevator.  However, he said: +But if you have to take public transport, the chance in Singapore of getting on a contaminated MRT, for example, is very low.+  Said Prof Wang: +But even if the hand is contaminated, you+re not going to be infected. It+s only when you rub your nose or your eyes. You just need to be cautious that when you go out in public... Then as soon as you get to the office or home, wash your hands. I think that+s the best you can do.+","104":"SINGAPORE - Nine in 10 imported Covid-19 cases in Singapore between Wednesday (March 18) and Friday last week did not show symptoms, like fever, when they had passed through the border checkpoints.  As a result, the cases were detected only later on, the Health Ministry said on Monday (March 23) in response to queries.  It explained that about 90 per cent of the imported cases reported in Singapore during the three-day period saw a doctor at a hospital or general practitioner+s clinic after they returned home.  +They had not displayed symptoms when at the checkpoints,+ it added.  Travellers into Singapore have to walk past thermal scanners, which would help identify those who are feverish. Those who are observed to be so, or have other respiratory symptoms will be required to do a Covid-19 swab test.  Singapore had 119 cases altogether in those three days, with 87 of them being imported cases, the ministry+s figures show.  There have been mounting concerns that people with coronavirus may not show symptoms, such as fever, dry cough and shortness of breath.  Scientists are calling for urgent studies to determine the proportion of people with coronavirus who show no, or delayed, symptoms, amid fears that the number of silent carriers may be greater than previously thought.  The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that as many as one-third of the people who test positive show delayed symptoms or none at all, citing classified data from the Chinese government.  In line with stiffer border controls to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, travellers entering Singapore, regardless of where they come from, have been given a 14-day stay-home notice since 11.59pm on Friday. It is mandatory even for those who are well.  The ministry had also said on Sunday that an additional precaution will be taken for those who come into close contact with a confirmed case on their flight back.  Related Story Coronavirus: All travellers arriving in Singapore must submit health declaration from Friday  They will be quarantined.  A quarantine order requires the person to stay put in a dedicated room with a toilet.  It is the strictest among the measures and is given to those who are, or are suspected of being, a carrier of the coronavirus.  In contrast, people serving a stay-home notice will not require a dedicated room and toilet, but they must stay home at all times.  Border control measures in Singapore will be intensified from 11.59pm on Monday (March 23) in a further effort to reduce the risk of importing coronavirus cases.  All short-term visitors, including tourists, will be barred from entering or transiting through Singapore.  Also, work-pass holders and their dependants will be allowed to return to Singapore only if they are employed in sectors that provide essential services, such as healthcare and transport.","105":"SINGAPORE - Enhanced social distancing measures were announced last Friday (March 13), gatherings are now being limited to 250 people at a time. Some people have asked if it is still safe to go swimming in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Q: Is it safe to go swimming during this period? Can the virus be transmitted through water?  A: It is known that the virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets and saliva, but there is currently no evidence suggesting that the virus can be spread through water, hence making swimming one of the safer sporting activities.  Infectious diseases expert Dr Leong Hoe Nam also suggests that it is generally safe to go swimming, as the water and chlorine within swimming pools could help to kill the virus.  People, however, should be mindful of their interactions with others outside of the water.  Professor Paul Tambyah from the department of medicine at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine noted media reports about an infection cluster in a South Korean church that sprayed saltwater in its churchgoers\u2019 mouths. However this incident does not provide clear evidence suggesting that the virus can be transmitted via water, he said.  Prof Tambyah also said that it is not known as to how long the virus can survive in plain water, and there has been no cases of viral transmission through plain water.  Thus, citing the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Prof Tambyah concludes that recreational activities in water is generally safe.  Q: What precautions should one take outside the swimming pool?  A: Individuals should practise good basic hygiene by refraining from sharing towels, and showering before entering the pool, said Prof Tambyah. He also cautions that individuals should avoid public pools when they are unwell, or if they are on a stay-at-home order.  As common facilities such as locker rooms and showers may be crowded, showering at home could be a safer precautionary measure.  Dr Leong also advised individuals to avoid lingering around the pool area, and to go home directly after swimming.  Those who need to use public shower facilities should opt for a single shower cubicle, he added  SportsSG has also regulated the number of people using the Active SG swimming pools at a single point in time, and closed off children pools until further notice.  These precautionary measures were implemented in line with the advisory issued by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on March 13, which said that sports centres with indoor facilities should limit the number of patrons and introduce physical separation measures, on top of increased cleaning frequency and issuing advisories to reduce unnecessary contact.  Related Story Coronavirus: Physical distancing measures at public sports facilities face hurdles  Q: Are lane segregation measures introduced effective against the spread of the virus?  A: Lane segregation has been implemented at running tracks and swimming pools, in line with the precautionary measures that came into force last Sunday (March 15).  This means that several running lanes are cordoned off at various stadiums, restricting runners to a few available lanes.  ActiveSG swimming pools have placed lane ropes restricting swimming to the length of the pool. Certain lanes have been allocated for swimming classes and lap swimming, while the remaining are available to the rest of the swimmers.  Experts have warned that while such social distancing measures make sense, people should still be wary of possible overcrowding situations.","106":"SINGAPORE - While the Republic continues to ramp up its fight against the coronavirus outbreak, it cannot drop its guard against its old foe, dengue, said Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli on Monday (March 23) at a panel discussion organised by The Straits Times on combating the spread of Covid-19 here.  As of Sunday, more than 4,000 people here had been infected with dengue fever, double the number of cases reported for the same period last year.  Worse still, said Mr Masagos, the strain of dengue threatening Singapore today, DENV-3, is one which many here do not have immunity against.  There are four dengue serotypes, with DENV-1 and DENV-2 being behind the outbreaks here. DENV-2 has been the dominant strain since 2016.  Mr Masagos warned: +The last time we had the DENV-3 outbreak was 30 years ago, which means that there+s a generation of us who do not have the antibodies or the immunity against (it)... it+s certainly something to cause alarm.+  He added: +We hope that as much as we are worried about Covid-19, we must not lose sight of ensuring that... we do not become lax.  +Yes, we start washing our hands - it+s fantastic, we don+t leave tissues on the table, but please continue to do the things that we have always been doing year after year to bring down and to keep suppressing the breeding of mosquitoes because that+s the only and best defence against dengue transmission.+  In response to the grim dengue outlook here, the National Environment Agency (NEA) had brought forward the launch of its annual dengue prevention campaign, which typically begins in April or May, to Sunday.  Also on Monday+s panel were Professor Wang Linfa, director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Medical School, Mr Edward D+Silva, chairman of the Public Hygiene Council, and Mr Tai Ji Choong, director of NEA+s Department of Public Cleanliness.  Prof Wang said that those who had previously been exposed to the DENV-1 and DENV-2 strains of dengue are at higher risk of getting a more severe infection from the DENV-3 strain due to a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement.  This occurs when antibodies that are already present in a person from a previous dengue infection bind to a new infectious dengue particle, but instead of neutralising the virus, help it infect the patient more efficiently.  Related Story 2 coronavirus patients test positive for dengue despite not having the mosquito-borne disease  Related Story Singapore faces dengue threat from emergence of little-seen strain  And while there is as yet no scientific evidence linking dengue and Covid-19, it is possible that a dengue infection might weaken a person+s immune system and make one more susceptible to Covid-19, said Prof Wang.  +You just want to keep healthy and avoid any infection, whether it+s dengue or Covid-19... These are two different viruses and two different approaches. But the principle is the same, it+s every citizen+s responsibility,+ he said.  Mr Masagos said: +The point is we don+t want to have two crises to fight.+  He added: +In Singapore, dengue is here to stay. Covid-19 is here but will hopefully go away. We must therefore not lose our sight on something which is also as dangerous, will also cause losses.+","111":"SINGAPORE - Twenty-nine patients recovering from Covid-19 were transferred from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases to a ward at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Orchard Road on Monday (March 23).  The move is aimed at freeing up capacity at public hospitals so they can take care of the more seriously ill Covid-19 patients.  The transferred patients were ones who were no longer sick, or needed less medical care, but were still shedding the virus.  They will be discharged once they are confirmed to be clear of the virus and no longer risk spreading the disease.  Mount Elizabeth Hospital is the first of four Parkway hospitals to take in Covid-19 patients from the public sector, said Dr Noel Yeo, senior vice-president of Parkway\u2019s hospital operations in Singapore.  The number of new infections here, especially imported ones, has been fairly high as residents return from high-infection countries.  There are now more than 300 Covid-19 patients hospitalised here.  The Health Ministry said that it expected the number of Covid-19 cases in Singapore to increase, and had plans in place to deal with increased demand for hospital and clinical services.  It has activated a collaboration between public and private hospitals to transfer well and stable Covid-19 patients to selected private hospitals so that capacity in the public sector may be freed for the management of more severe cases.  Over the past three days, the National Centre for Infectious Diseases had transferred 20 patients to Concord International Hospital, in addition to 29 patients to Mount Elizabeth Hospital, via dedicated ambulances, it said in a statement on Monday.  Obstetricians at Parkway East had expressed concerns that the ward for the Covid-19 patients is on the same floor as the maternity ward.  However, Dr Yeo said: \u201cThe same stringent safety protocols and precautionary measures will apply for these new patients, who will be housed in a single ward at the hospital.\u201d  Related Story SGH sets up fever screening area in carpark as cases spike  These patients will not be allowed to leave the ward, nor allowed any visitors. All staff working in areas where the patients are must don protective apparel.  He added that the areas these patients had passed through during the transfer will be thoroughly cleaned and sanitised.  Dr Yeo said: \u201cWe have been working closely with the Ministry of Health on joining the national effort against Covid-19, and how private sector resources may be utilised to alleviate the load on public healthcare institutions.\u201d  He hopes other private sector hospitals will also \u201cplay their part to complement these efforts\u201d.  Last week, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said Singapore has sufficient healthcare facilities and workers to cope with the current number of Covid-19 patients.  He said there are also contingency plans if numbers go up.  These include opening up more wards in public hospitals as well as using quarantine facilities for recovering patients.  MOH said on Monday that there are plans to further collaborate with private hospitals to manage Covid-19 cases, as well as patients with other conditions, to free up capacity in the public sector."},"caption":{"2":"+Schools re-open tomorrow.
