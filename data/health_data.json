Employers who place their staff on this voluntary LOA will be able to claim daily support under a programme by the MOM aimed at alleviating the companies+ financial burden during the Covid-19 outbreak.  This initiative follows recent, stricter measures imposed by schools to curb the spread of the coronavirus, after more infections and a surge in imported cases were recorded in Singapore.  All students and staff who returned from overseas between last Saturday (March 14) and this Friday will be put on a mandatory 14-day leave of absence from the date of return.  From 11.59pm on Friday, all arriving travellers, including Singaporeans, will face even more stringent measures and will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice.  This means they will not be able to leave their homes for 14 days.  In encouraging companies to voluntarily impose the LOA on Friday, the MOM said: +The Government recognises that many parents have been affected by this national measure due to the need to provide care for their children during this period.  +At the same time, it is a useful precautionary measure for people who have travelled recently to stay away from the workplace to prevent further transmission.+  The MOM said companies should adopt flexible work arrangements to allow these employees to work from home during that whole 14-day period.  It noted that some companies had already voluntarily asked employees to stay home after returning from trips overseas between last Saturday and Friday.  Such companies should continue with existing flexible work and leave arrangements, including asking their employees to use their annual leave to cover the company imposed LOA, said the MOM.  However, for those companies that have not put such measures in place, +employers are encouraged to provide additional paid leave to the employees, if work from home is not feasible+, considering that the LOA option was not known before their employees travelled.  To help these companies, the MOM will allow them to apply for the $100 daily support under the LOA support programme, which covers only employees who are Singaporeans, permanent residents or work pass holders.  Companies can also claim a levy waiver for their affected work pass holders.  Those who are self-employed and who have to put themselves on LOA will similarly be allowed to claim this daily support.  Eligible employers will be able to apply for daily support for each affected employee after their LOA is completed.  However, employers, self-employed Singaporeans and permanent residents will not be able to claim under the support programme if they worked remotely during the LOA period or if the affected employee had to use his or her own annual leave, childcare leave or any other kind of leave to cover the LOA.  Additionally, those who have been placed on stay-home notice upon returning to Singapore and whose travel was not between March 14 to 20 are not eligible for daily support under this programme.  Said the MOM: +As the Covid-19 situation continues to evolve, there may be additional requirements imposed on work pass holders from time to time.+  It urged employers and employees to check the MOM website for the latest advisories.

The churches plan to be open before the weekend of April 4 and 5, the start of Holy Week, which is the week leading up to Easter Sunday on April 12.  In the meantime, online weekend services will be conducted, and pastoral care will given to the elderly and the vulnerable.

Among them, 33 were imported and 30 involved Singapore residents returning from abroad. This brought the total number of cases here to 313.  In light of these recent developments, it is vital that people mind their health, and take the necessary precautions should they feel unwell.  Q: What are the symptoms for Covid-19?  The two most common symptoms for Covid-19 are fever (of 37.8 deg C and above) and cough.  Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam said that those who are experiencing either of the two symptoms, or both, should consult a doctor.  He also added that those who feel generally unwell should also see a doctor, noting that practically all the identified Covid-19 cases had the sensation of being unwell at some point.  Q: What about mild, flu-like symptoms which are not fever and cough? Should I visit the doctor as well?  Other mild, flu-like symptoms such as sore throat, stuffy nose and runny nose should be monitored closely for at least five days, said Dr Leong, as sore throat and stuffy nose were not symptoms present in 90 per cent of the confirmed Covid-19 cases.  However, people should look out for any prolonged or worsening symptoms, as well as new, developing symptoms, he noted, and see a doctor if these occur.  In the meantime, individuals should practise self-quarantine measures at home and avoid going out, as there is a chance they could be incubating the virus.  Q: Can I self-medicate at home if I+m facing any of the above symptoms?  You may self-medicate if you are facing mild symptoms. However, you should visit a doctor if the symptoms are prolonged or worsening.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  If you are having a cough or fever, which are common Covid-19 symptoms, you should definitely visit a doctor.  On whether people suffering from Covid-19 symptoms should avoid taking ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug meant for fever and pain, Dr Leong said that it has not yet been clinically proven that the drug predisposes the body to more infections.  But he suggests they choose alternatives such as paracetamol, synflex or voltaren as a precautionary measure.  Q: Should I visit the doctor if I+m experiencing breathlessness?  Yes, although breathlessness does not usually develop until the later stages of Covid-19. By then, individuals would have experienced other accompanying symptoms as well, noted Dr Leong.  Dr Piotr Chlebicki, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Alvernia Hospital, also shared the same advice, adding that breathlessness is cause for medical attention, as the individual could be facing other complications like heart disease or asthma.  Q: What if I am asymptomatic so far, but I don+t feel very well in general, should I still see the doctor?  Yes, as long as you are feeling unwell, or sense that something is out of the ordinary, it would be a good idea to visit the doctor.  Dr Chlebicki also suggested that it would be good practice to call in to clinics before going, as this could help reduce overcrowding.  In addition, you should also refrain from doctor-hopping, said MOH in an advisory on March 11, as going back to the same doctor could ensure follow-up, and that you+re sent for Covid-19 testing if necessary.","12":"SINGAPORE - New developments for the Covid-19 situation have been coming thick and fast over the past few days, with Malaysia deciding to impose a lockdown and fresh travel restrictions being put in place by Singapore.

The move, which will take effect from 11.59pm on Friday (March 20), was among new measures announced to contain the spread of coronavirus cases. To date, Singapore has reported a total of 313 cases.  Here+s what you need to know about SHN, based on the Ministry of Health advisory:  1. Am I under quarantine orders if I am on SHN?  No, you are not under quarantine orders and are not required to have a dedicated room and toilet if this is not feasible. However, you should remain in your place of residence at all times during the 14-day period.  2. What is the difference between leave of absence and SHN?  People taking leave of absence are allowed to leave their place of residence to purchase daily necessities or to attend to important personal matters.  Those issued a SHN should remain in their place of residence at all times during the 14-day period.  3. Can my family members continue to stay with me during this time? Are they at risk of infection?  Your family members may continue to live with you. However, you and your family should observe good personal hygiene practices. If you become unwell, avoid contact with your family members and seek medical attention immediately.  4. My family members\/flatmates\/tenants have just returned from one of the affected areas. Can I still carry on with my daily activities, such as going to work or school?  Yes, the SHN applies only to persons returning from affected areas listed in the advisory (NOTE: From Friday, March 20, at 11.59pm, the SHN will be extended to all people arriving from overseas). Nonetheless, you should continue to monitor your health, observe good personal hygiene and seek medical attention if unwell.  5. Do I need to declare to my employers\/schools that I am on SHN?  Those who have returned from the affected areas are advised to inform their employers or schools that they are on SHN. This is so that your employer or school can provide the necessary assistance to facilitate your SHN.  6. If I am delivering food\/supplies to a person under SHN, should I wear a mask or other protective equipment to protect myself?  There is no need for masks or other protective equipment. The delivery can be conducted in such a way as to minimise contact with the person under SHN. The SHN is a precautionary measure and persons under SHN are not close contacts of confirmed cases.  7. Can I send my employees\/students to the doctor to get tested at the end of the 14-day period so that they can be cleared to come back to work\/return to school?  It is not useful to send persons who do not have symptoms to the doctor\/hospital for testing. Such individuals will not be offered diagnostic testing, and will be asked to return home.  8. What if I do not comply with the SHN?  If you fail to comply with the SHN, you may face the following penalties, as you have put the well-being of the wider community at risk:  a. You may be prosecuted under Section 21A of the Infectious Diseases Act.  b.

In addition, its riders must wash or sanitise their hands before and after shifts and have been asked to sterilise their delivery bags at least twice a day to prevent any contamination in the delivery process.  Grab and Deliveroo will provide financial support for riders who are infected by the coronavirus or have to be isolated as a precautionary measure.  Labour MP Ang Hin Kee said such financial support would help to discourage unwell people from working.  He added: +It is essential that platform operators do right by clients and riders.  +Responsible companies extend their care and concern beyond their staff and to others contracted with them. I would urge that, by demonstrating such concerns, more will use their platforms.+","66":"SINGAPORE - All foreign domestic workers entering Singapore will be served a 14-day stay-home notice, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Sunday (March 15).  All employers and employment agencies planning for their foreign domestic workers to enter Singapore will also need to obtain the MOM+s approval before the workers commence their journey.  These measures, taken in view of the rapid spread of Covid-19 worldwide, would affect both new and returning workers.  They would take effect from 11.59pm on Monday.  +The new measures take into consideration that FDWs live with families and many look after young children and the elderly,+ said the MOM.  It said all new incoming foreign domestic workers must serve their stay-home notices at an alternative accommodation (dormitories, hostels or hotels) before they can be deployed for employment.  For domestic workers returning from overseas, their employers can arrange for them to serve the notice in the employer+s residential address, or alternative accommodation.  On the entry approval for the domestic workers, the MOM said the application can be done online.  The applicant - either the employer or the employment agency - will be responsible for ensuring that the domestic worker complies with the stay-home notice.  They also have to ensure that the worker has access to a local mobile phone and remains contactable by the MOM during the 14-day period.  The ministry said that employers and agencies should ask the domestic worker not to make travel plans until approval is obtained.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  +The employment agencies or employers will be required to send the MOM approval letter to the FDWs, who will need to show it to the airline staff during check-in and at the ICA checkpoint upon arrival in Singapore,+ said the MOM.  It also said that it is the collective responsibility of all involved to ensure that the new requirements are complied with.  +Enforcement action, including revocation of work passes and suspension of work pass privileges, will be taken if the requirements are not complied with,+ the MOM added.  +Demerit points will also be imposed on agencies whose actions result in violation of the requirements by the FDWs.+  Employers of domestic workers who do not serve their stay-home notices at the employer+s registered residential addresses can apply to tap a support package from the MOM.  This package will allow eligible employers who are Singapore citizens or permanent residents to get $60 support daily per affected domestic worker and have their levy waived during the stay-home notice period.  More details on the application process will be made known at a later stage.  The MOM said: +Prospective employers should factor in the new requirements, including cost implications, in their hiring decisions.  +They should also consider renewing their existing FDW+s contract or hire a transfer FDW instead.+  Related Story Coronavirus: Singaporeans out in force over the weekend despite social distancing measures  It also strongly encouraged domestic workers to spend their rest day at home, and urged employers to work out the appropriate arrangements to facilitate this.  The MOM added that employers should work with foreign domestic workers to come to a mutual agreement for workers to postpone plans, if any, to travel back home until the coronavirus outbreak stabilises.","67":"SINGAPORE - Singaporeans and Malaysians travelling into Singapore from Malaysia via sea or land will be exempted from the new border restrictions on Asean countries, due to the close proximity and high inter-dependency between the two neighbours.  But separate arrangements for precautions are being worked out by a bilateral joint working group, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said on Sunday (March 15).  The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Sunday announced that from 11.59pm on Monday, all travellers - including Singapore citizens, permanent residents, long-term pass holders, and short-term visitors - entering Singapore with recent travel history to Asean countries, Japan, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom within the last 14 days will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice (SHN).  But Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the coronavirus outbreak, said such restrictions on those coming in from Malaysia would be complex.  He noted that 300,000 people move across the land crossings at the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints alone on a daily basis.  +We do have to put in place some special considerations for Malaysia because of the close proximity and the high inter-dependency between our two countries,+ said Mr Wong.  +So for now, the arrangements which I just described will not apply to our sea and land crossings with Malaysia.+  Malaysia reported 190 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, with most linked to a religious event at a mosque that was attended by more than 10,000 people from several countries.  The new cases bring the total number of infections in the country to 428.  Mr Wong added: +We do need precautions to be taken at these checkpoints, but it is going to be more complex, given the high volume of people moving in and out of these checkpoints.  +We want precautions to be taken there, and so separate arrangements are being worked out by the bilateral joint working group we have with Malaysia.+","74":"SINGAPORE - A call by the Government to observe social distancing to keep the coronavirus at bay drew mixed reactions on Saturday as many Singaporeans tried to live life as normally as they could.  Shaking off cabin fever, many emerged from their homes to do grocery shopping and eat out at shopping malls and open-air public places like hawker centres, although they were still cautious about the threat of the coronavirus and mindful that they needed to steer clear of very crowded areas.  A 40-year-old housewife who wanted to be known only as Melissa was doing some shopping for her family at Junction 8: +I avoid touristy spots and airports.  +I can+t avoid going to certain places like malls, I need to do grocery shopping... It comes to a point where you can+t stay at home. Kids get cabin fever.+  Quality control officer Ahmad Tirmuzi Bin Mazlan, 27, who was also at Junction 8 said: +I still meet my friends once or twice a week, although I am increasingly cautious about the numbers. I come home straight away after work, but I still go shopping sometimes.+  Then there were others who were unfazed.  +There are no changes to our schedule,+ said assistant manager Adrem Tan, 31, who was at children+s toys and clothes shop Kiddy Palace with his wife and three young children. +We don+t avoid going to any place. We also don+t buy masks or take any precautions.+  The comments follow stronger steps taken by the government on Friday to implement social distancing as a major line of defence.  This involves deferring or cancelling all ticketed cultural, sports and entertainment events with 250 participants or more. Large private functions and religious services should not have more than 250 attendees.  Owners and tenants of venues that are publicly accessible were also advised to take precautions where possible. These include keeping seats at least one metre apart at dining outlets, limiting the number of visitors at any one time at entertainment venues and tourist attractions such as casinos, cinemas and theme parks.  But these suggestions did not seem to be taken too seriously by residents in public spaces and malls on Saturday.  It was business as usual at lunchtime at Ikea Tampines, with patrons crowding the cafeteria without any distancing between them.

Passengers on the free shuttle buses to Sembawang Shopping Centre were seated with no appreciable distance between them.  Popular outlets like Chic-a-boo and Burger King also did not appear to be prescribing where people should be seated, though workers were seen to be cleaning tables after every customer.  There were some people who dutifully kept a distance from other diners at Sembawang Food Centre, where operators marked out alternate seats with bright red tape - which meant that these should not be used.

It was helter-skelter after Malaysia announced a two-week national lockdown on Monday night. The disorder was not just over there but also in Singapore because of the close ties between the two countries.  Students and workers scrambled across the Causeway to beat the lockdown deadline as employers here sought lodgings for their workers.  Like China and Italy, Malaysia has taken drastic action to counter a surge in coronavirus cases, mostly linked to a mass religious event in late February.  When asked if Singapore would consider such a move, which is also in place in France and being considered in London, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong told a press conference on Tuesday that while he could not rule it out, it was not on the cards.  Observers and public health experts say the chaos that ensued after Malaysia+s lockdown showed why such a measure would be warranted only if the outbreak gets out of hand and the benefits outweigh the costs.  Dr Gillian Koh, deputy director for research at the Institute of Policy Studies, told The New Paper: +Singapore+s survival and sustainability depends on borders being open and receiving goods as well as people.  +So the cost of locking down Singapore is very high, both for the economy and for sustaining daily life itself.+  But a recent spike in the number of infections has led to online ire and frustration over people here going on holidays despite advisories to defer non-essential travel.  A record 47 new cases were reported on Wednesday, of which 30 were Singapore residents returning from abroad.  Yesterday, for the first time in five days, the number of new cases dropped, as 32 infections were confirmed, of which 24 were imported, all involving returning Singapore residents.  Arguing why a lockdown was highly unlikely, Dr Koh said: +Even with returning Singaporeans, we have very stringent protocols and all of us do expect them to abide by them... to ensure that we keep the extreme scenario of a lockdown as far away as possible.+  National University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser said it was understandable that Singaporeans felt negatively towards people they deemed socially irresponsible.  Singapore Management University law don Eugene Tan agreed but felt these sentiments would weaken after the outbreak.  Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, infectious diseases programme leader at Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at NUS, said a lockdown is a +nuclear option+ reserved for when community transmission has to be brought under control quickly.  While this seems to have worked for China, which yesterday saw zero new infections in Hubei province for the first time since the virus emerged there, Prof Hsu said lockdowns cannot be done indefinitely.  With the virus spreading in so many countries, it could also still be re-imported.  Whether an outbreak is severe enough to warrant such an extreme measure depends on how much each society can tolerate its costs, said Prof Hsu.  +Sometimes that price is far higher than what the virus can do,+ he added.  TESTING CAPACITY  Making a comparison with South Korea+s approach, which involved expanding its testing capacity rapidly and implementing strict social distancing, Prof Hsu said each country had to find the right balance and use its strengths where possible to control the outbreak.  +We are fortunate that community transmission is low at present, and there is more leeway in terms of what we can do,+ he added.  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore General Hospital to convert part of carpark into fever screening area  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam said it is thanks to the hard work put in earlier during the outbreak that a lockdown is not needed here.  Prof Hsu said what Singapore is doing now is to try to prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed at its current capacity, or what is known as flattening the curve.  But at the same time, he said Singapore can also prepare for a possible surge and try to expand healthcare capacity.  He suggested training people to take over some of the work done by nurses so they can be freed up for other tasks.  +For the regular patients... they can just be isolated in a facility where they can+t transmit the virus but can be monitored and taken care of in a way that doesn+t require the heavy resources of a hospital bed or an isolation room,+ Prof Hsu said.  Dr Leong was optimistic that Singapore could maintain its efforts in fighting the virus over the next three to six months but warned against complacency.  Reminding the public to stay home if unwell and urging them to defer travel plans, he said: +We have all the necessary ingredients to overcome this outbreak. But all this is hanging precariously. If we are not careful, it can be lost at the drop of a hat.+  LISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST","85":"SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - Movie theatres worldwide are being shut down, but the show is going on for local cinema chains.  Golden Village, Shaw Theatres, Cathay Cineplexes and The Projector told The New Paper they remain open amid the Covid-19 outbreak and have no plans to cease operations for now.  And with every tentpole summer blockbuster - No Time To Die, Mulan, Fast & Furious 9, A Quiet Place Part II and most recently Black Widow - postponing its release dates, cinemas here have come up with new ways to draw audiences and sustain their business.  A Golden Village spokesman said new titles will still be released in the coming weeks \u2013 including Guns Akimbo starring Daniel Radcliffe, Japanese thriller A.I. Amok and Thai rom-com Low Season \u2013 and it has re-released a trio of Korean zombie films.  It will also be bringing back older Hollywood movies \u2013 like Mile 22, 21 Bridges and Midway \u2013 at GVmax for $5 and curating thematic event screenings for families, singles and dedicated film buffs.  Shaw Theatres and Cathay Cineplexes are reviewing their programming and turning to their own titles to bolster their line-up.  New measures have also been added in line with the Ministry of Health+s social distancing guidelines. Golden Village and Shaw Theatres have implemented compulsory seat gaps between patrons to ensure they are at least one metre apart.  Shaw Theatres has also reduced some sessions so that more time can be allocated between screenings for thorough cleaning of the halls.  While cinemas struggle to retain audiences, home-viewing platforms have enjoyed a spike in demand.

He shares more.  Q Why do children seem to be less affected by Covid-19 than adults?  A We know that there are other diseases where children are not affected as much. For instance, chicken pox is a much milder illness in children than in adults.  And a child with Hepatitis A (a viral liver disease) probably does not have symptoms, but they might have antibodies if you test them, whereas adults with Hepatitis A will develop fever and jaundice.  So, we know that children and adults have a different sort of immune system. The children could be - for reasons we do not yet understand - less likely to have symptoms.  If studies done to find out if children have antibodies to Covid-19 show that there are a lot of asymptomatic children, it will prove - but it will not tell us why - that children are getting infected but not showing symptoms.  Q Should we worry about children passing Covid-19 to the elderly?  A That is another question we do not yet know the answer to. However, if they are asymptomatic, they are less likely to do so.  In fact, a lot of the swabs that we have taken from family clusters have shown that while the parents might have had the disease and had symptoms, the children are completely well, even though they tested positive.  We have no evidence that the child in those family clusters was the first person to get it.  If you are asymptomatic, you are much less likely to spread it because you are not coughing, you are not making the droplets. Is it theoretically possible to spread it if you share a pair of chopsticks, for instance? We think it is probably theoretically possible, but it is certainly not a major driver of the outbreak. The money is on people with symptoms spreading the disease before they are diagnosed and isolated.  It is more the other way around - the parents have infected the child and the child is asymptomatic, but you can find (the virus) in their throat.  If you are asymptomatic, you are much less likely to spread it because you are not coughing, you are not making the droplets.  Is it theoretically possible to spread it if you share a pair of chopsticks, for instance?  We think it is probably theoretically possible, but it is certainly not a major driver of the outbreak.  The money is on people with symptoms spreading the disease before they are diagnosed and isolated.  So, if that period is a week, they are going to spread it a lot. If it is two days, they will not spread it so much.  If it is two days where they stayed home because they were not feeling well, then they will spread the disease to even fewer people, or to no one.  We know that younger people are unlikely to get serious illness, but they can be an important part of transmission and every young person in Singapore has parents and grandparents who are older.  Everyone needs to pull together to do their part, to help save lives.","96":"SINGAPORE - All short-term visitors will no longer be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore from 11.59pm on Monday (March 23) in view of the heightened risks of importing coronavirus cases into the country.  Work pass holders and their dependants will be allowed to return to Singapore only if they work in sectors that provide essential services such as healthcare and transport.  This will also kick in at 11.59pm on Monday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a statement on Sunday.  The measures were announced a day after two patients - a 75-year-old Singaporean woman and a 64-year-old Indonesian man - died from Covid-19 due to complications. They were the first deaths the Republic has seen in the Covid-19 outbreak.  National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said at a briefing on Sunday morning that the measures to +significantly tighten+ Singapore+s borders are taken in the light of the rapidly escalating virus outbreak around the world.  Previously, except for a handful of countries, short-term visitors from elsewhere were allowed to come into Singapore but were issued a 14-day stay-home notice (SHN) upon arrival.  This meant, however, that resources were being expended to serve and enforce SHNs on them, and if they fell ill, to provide them with medical treatment. On Saturday, there were still 533 short-term visitors arriving in Singapore.  To date, there are more than 260,000 Covid-19 cases across 185 countries, and around 11,200 deaths.  The MOH said that in Singapore, almost 80 per cent of new Covid-19 cases over the past three days were imported, most of them Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning home from abroad.  These imported cases had travel histories to 22 different countries.  There were 432 cases of coronavirus patients in Singapore as of Saturday evening. A total of 140 cases have fully recovered. Of the 290 patients still in hospital, most are stable or improving, but 14 are in critical care.  On the limited entry for work pass holders and their dependants, the Manpower Ministry will allow this only for those in essential services.  On what constitutes essential services, Mr Wong said the Ministry of Manpower will continue to approve applications for the workers to come back according to existing rules, with inputs from relevant government agencies when needed.  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore residents who travel overseas may face consequences as Govt ramps up border controls  He added that foreign domestic helpers could also be considered as offering essential services, especially in cases where they are needed to help look after children or the elderly.  As previously announced, all Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders returning will continue to be issued a 14-day SHN.  In addition, Malaysians with Singapore work permits can continue to work in the Republic during this period, with accommodation arrangements.  Transport of goods between both countries will also be facilitated, the Singapore-Malaysia Special Working Committee has agreed.  Diplomats accredited and based in Singapore can continue to come in. They will also be subjected to the 14-day isolation.  On Sunday, Mr Wong said that these were very significant moves especially for a small open economy like Singapore which has always been connected to the world.  +But this is an unprecedented crisis,+ he said.  He noted that while very few short-term visitors have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, they can take up enforcement and medical resources.  +During this time, we have to focus our resources on returning Singaporeans,+ he said.  On how long these measure will remain in place, he said: +I can+t say at this stage. No one will know how long this current wave of imported cases we are experiencing will last for.+  He added: +It depends on how long the outbreak is going to continue in Europe and America, which are now the new epicentres for the virus outbreak. It (also) depends on how long more we will see returning Singaporeans coming back, so we will monitor on a day by day basis.+  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore residents who travel overseas may face consequences as Govt ramps up border controls  Mr Wong also warned that the Government is considering measures against those who choose to travel overseas despite the border control measures.  +I don+t think we can allow this to continue. We are discussing what additional measures may be needed,+ he said, adding that work pass holders who leave Singapore at this time may face the consequence of not being allowed entry later.  In recent days, most of the new patients in Singapore have been imported cases, that is, returning residents and long-term pass holders with travel history to Europe, North America, South-east Asia and other parts of Asia.  Besides strict border controls, rigorous contact tracing, quarantine and home isolation, the Government has implemented safe distancing measures such as smaller crowd sizes and keeping safe spaces around individuals, especially vulnerable segments of the population like the elderly.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  For example, all events and gatherings with 250 or more participants are to be suspended until June 30, while the suspension of all social activities for seniors by government agencies will be extended for another two weeks until April 7.

He said Singapore must brace itself for more losses even as healthcare workers do their best to care for patients.  He also urged everyone to work together with the Government in its efforts to slow the spread of the virus.","97":"SINGAPORE - The World Health Organisation director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus dispensed advice on how people can look after their health at a media briefing on Friday (March 20).

In his opening remarks at the briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, he included the following health tips:  First, eat a health and nutritious diet, which helps your immune system to function properly.  Second, limit your alcohol consumption, and avoid sugary drinks.  Third, do not smoke, he said, as smoking damages your lungs and can increase your risk of developing severe disease if you become infected with Covid-19.  Fourth, exercise. WHO recommends 30 minutes of physical activity a day for adults, and one hour a day for children.  If allowed, go outside for a walk or a run, while keeping a safe distance from others.

The Ministry of Health had announced measures to reduce the risk of local transmission of the coronavirus, including requiring public venues like eateries, shops and cinemas to keep patrons at least 1m apart.  Though the measures were to be rolled out progressively from Saturday, preparations had already begun at several businesses.  Casual restaurant chain Collin+s has already moved out around 10 per cent of its tables in its Nex shopping mall outlet to ensure adequate spacing between groups of diners.  Mr Jonathan Lim, 48, chief development officer at SF Group, Collin+s parent company, said: +It+s a bit of a sacrifice and dine-in business has been impacted slightly.

Mr Seah Kian Peng, group chief executive of FairPrice Group, said that 1m floor markers at the checkout counters and storewide announcements every 30 minutes to remind customers to space themselves would be progressively implemented at all 148 FairPrice outlets. He said, however, that there are no plans at the moment to limit the number of shoppers in stores.  NEA and town councils are also in the process of marking out seats at hawker centres to guide patrons on how to practise safe distancing.  To help businesses comply with the new requirements, Enterprise Singapore, the National Environment Agency, the Singapore Food Agency and the Singapore Tourism Board issued two joint advisories on Friday with steps the firms can take.  For instance, it said retail shops may use floor markers, along with clear signage, to indicate queuing positions for fitting rooms and at cashiers.  Shops may also limit the number of people within the store and let shoppers in progressively though supermarkets are advised not to create queues outside their stores.  Food and beverage establishments were advised to reduce queues outside their outlets by taking down diners+ details and calling them when seats are available. If not possible, the 1m floor markers, with clear signage, should be used to manage the crowd.

ST PHOTO: NG SOR LUAN    The advisories also encouraged the use of self-checkout counters, cashless payments and mobile ordering to both speed up payment and prevent crowding at cashiers and pick-up points.  Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Chee Hong Tat, who on Friday visited some businesses in Nex mall in Serangoon that were putting safe-distancing precautions in place, said the effectiveness of the measures requires the cooperation of everyone.  +The (floor) markers may be there but the public must also get used to making some of these adjustments,+ said Mr Chee.  Most of the shoppers The Straits Times spoke to welcomed the moves.
