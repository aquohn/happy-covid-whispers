special effort to create and post light-hearted videos about the coronavirus.  Here are 9 videos that have been making the rounds online:  1. Gloria Gaynor washing her hands to I Will Survive  Singer Gloria Gaynor parlayed her 1978 hit I Will Survive about living through a break-up into an anthem for Covid-19 prevention on video-sharing social network platform TikTok - complete with a demonstration.  2. Racism in the wizarding world  Australian news and satire television show The Feed transports the ongoing pandemic to the imaginary world of J.K. Rowling+s Harry Potter, with Asian students at Hogwarts - who are all sorted into Ravenclaw, by the way - expressing, hilariously, their bafflement at the discrimination they face from other students and the school.  The video ridicules the issue of racism in associating the virus with Chinese people. One student for instance, is told she must quarantine herself if she had returned home for the holidays - but home is Glasgow.  3. Batman cosplayer shunned  The panicked and uninformed behaviour in the early days of Covid-19 make for some comic relief in this video by actor Mark Lee+s King Kong Media Production. Cosplay enthusiast +Mr An+, for instance, laments how he is shunned as his chosen persona of Batman.  Jokes aside, the 7 minute 45 second video, posted in Mandarin with English subtitles, has a serious purpose as it debunks some of the misinformation circulating around the outbreak.  4. We won+t get no, corona infection  In this 1 minute 49 second YouTube video put up by user Nympha Tanieca, buskers wearing surgical masks and plastic hazmat suits play around with the lyrics of The Rolling Stones+ 1965 hit (I Can+t Get No) Satisfaction, to advocate social responsibility and proper hygiene.  5. Dancing the virus away  French health insurance company Assurance Maladie has turned unsexy good practices, such as sneezing into elbows, into a cheeky contemporary dance number.  Dancers dressed in red demonstrate how to properly discard tissue paper, wash hands, and don face masks in a video that is sure to get you grooving to the beat.  6. Learn hygiene tips from children  Educational YouTube channel for pre-schoolers, Superhero Me, has uploaded a 4 minute 10 second clip on how to keep the virus at bay. In the clip, children share tips on how to wash hands correctly, wear a mask and the proper etiquette in sneezing or coughing.  7. 6-year-old boy makes washing hands fun  For an extremely thorough demonstration of handwashing, look no further than six-year-old Wilder Rowen, who shows how to +pet the dog+, +milk the cow+ and do a spider to +get all the yucks out+ from under the nails in this home video.  The 2 minute 19 second clip was uploaded on to American news site abc30 on Thursday.  8. The Coronavirus Safety Song  In this video, YouTuber Sawan Dutta says a medical practitioner friend in the United States asks that Bengali Aunty - a character she plays in her videos - create a song based on the US government+s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for hand-washing.  What transpires is Bengali Aunty singing +Wash your hands, wash your hands\/ Clean out every pore\/ The deadly Coronavirus\/Is knocking at your door,+ in a musical video that almost verges on the surreal.  9. Mask-hoarding during the outbreak  In this satire set in a dystopian future six months after the outbreak, surgical masks are sold out everywhere and have become the new currency. Turned away at a convenience store for paying with cash, a character is left with no choice but to pay with her precious hand sanitiser. Those who hoard the masks, the Hoarder Gang, now sell them for extortionate prices, but their plans are foiled when the vaccine for the virus is found.  The 6 minute 14 second clip was uploaded on to YouTube by channel Wah!Banana and ends with the cast reminding viewers to not hoard masks and trust mainstream media to avoid spreading fake news.","27":"SINGAPORE - The major food delivery companies - GrabFood, Deliveroo and foodpanda - are stepping up precautionary measures to help contain the escalating coronavirus outbreak.  The steps include encouraging riders to take their temperatures and letting them drop off food without having physical contact with customers.  From Tuesday (March 17), Deliveroo customers will be able to opt to pick up their food orders from a thermal bag placed on the floor while the delivery rider waits at least 1m away.  And people ordering via GrabFood can alert Grab via its feedback channels of any food delivery rider who seems unwell. Riders can do the same if they encounter customers who appear ill.  Anyone who is repeatedly flagged as showing respiratory syndromes will be asked to see a doctor and get medical clearance before they can continue using the GrabFood platform.  Many of these measures were already in place before a GrabFood rider - believed to be the first case of an infected food delivery rider here - was confirmed with Covid-19 on Friday (March 13).  Grab, which runs the largest food delivery operator in GrabFood, said: +All partners are not allowed to come in contact with the food; they are instructed not to touch or open the food containers.  +All partners are advised to measure their temperature at least twice a day, practice good hygiene and to not work if they present any forms of respiratory symptoms, or are generally feeling unwell.+  Deliveroo said it has been giving out face masks to riders at designated locations.  Related Story Coronavirus: Grab closes Marina One offices for five days after employee found to be infected  Related Story Coronavirus: Singaporeans out in force over the weekend despite social distancing measures  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  It added: +If a rider does feel an area is high risk and they wish to not do deliveries, they can request to cancel any booked deliveries without penalty.+  Foodpanda has also been distributing free face masks and hand sanitisers to riders and made it compulsory for them to have these items on shift.  In addition, its riders must wash or sanitise their hands before and after shifts and have been asked to sterilise their delivery bags at least twice a day to prevent any contamination in the delivery process.  Grab and Deliveroo will provide financial support for riders who are infected by the coronavirus or have to be isolated as a precautionary measure.  Labour MP Ang Hin Kee said such financial support would help to discourage unwell people from working.  He added: +It is essential that platform operators do right by clients and riders.  +Responsible companies extend their care and concern beyond their staff and to others contracted with them. I would urge that, by demonstrating such concerns, more will use their platforms.+","36":"SINGAPORE - Singaporeans and residents returning to the country will all have to serve a 14-day stay-home notice (SHN).  The move, which took effect on March 20, was among new measures announced to contain the spread of coronavirus cases. To date, Singapore has reported a total of 313 cases.  Here+s what you need to know about SHN, based on the Ministry of Health advisory:  1. Am I under quarantine orders if I am on SHN?  No, you are not under quarantine orders and are not required to have a dedicated room and toilet if this is not feasible. However, you should remain in your place of residence at all times during the 14-day period.  2. What is the difference between leave of absence and SHN?  People taking leave of absence are allowed to leave their place of residence to purchase daily necessities or to attend to important personal matters.  Those issued a SHN should remain in their place of residence at all times during the 14-day period.  3. Can my family members continue to stay with me during this time? Are they at risk of infection?  Your family members may continue to live with you. However, you and your family should observe good personal hygiene practices. If you become unwell, avoid contact with your family members and seek medical attention immediately.  4. My family members\/flatmates\/tenants have just returned from one of the affected areas. Can I still carry on with my daily activities, such as going to work or school?  Yes, the SHN applies only to individuals who are served the notice. Nonetheless, you should continue to monitor your health, observe good personal hygiene and seek medical attention if unwell.  5. Do I need to declare to my employers\/schools that I am on SHN?  Those who have returned from the affected areas are advised to inform their employers or schools that they are on SHN. This is so that your employer or school can provide the necessary assistance to facilitate your SHN.  6. If I am delivering food\/supplies to a person under SHN, should I wear a mask or other protective equipment to protect myself?  There is no need for masks or other protective equipment. The delivery can be conducted in such a way as to minimise contact with the person under SHN. The SHN is a precautionary measure and persons under SHN are not close contacts of confirmed cases.  7. Can I send my employees\/students to the doctor to get tested at the end of the 14-day period so that they can be cleared to come back to work\/return to school?  It is not useful to send persons who do not have symptoms to the doctor\/hospital for testing. Such individuals will not be offered diagnostic testing, and will be asked to return home.  8.

LISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST","40":"SINGAPORE - A virus may be detectable on a surface days after a patient leaves behind traces, but this does not necessarily mean it is still infectious, experts say.  This is because most detection methods are picking up the presence of the viral genetic material, which may linger for days even after the structure of the virus itself is broken.  An intact structure is needed for a virus to infect a host, such as a human, said Professor Wang Linfa, director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Medical School.  +Currently, the only way we can detect (the presence of the virus) is through its nucleic acid material, and this may or may not mean that we still have a live virus,+ he told The Straits Times.  +This is why hygiene is very important, because disinfectants and soap can get rid of live viruses that are transmissible.+  His points clarify a study by the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which was published on Monday (March 23).  In the study, the CDC said that the genetic material of the coronavirus could be detected on surfaces in the cabins of infected passengers on board a cruise ship for up to 17 days after cabins were vacated, but before disinfection procedures had been conducted.  Prof Wang is not the only expert to weigh in on the study.  Dr Michael Mina, a physician and Assistant Professor in Immunology and Infectious Diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said on Twitter that the CDC findings did not did not show that the virus causing Covid-19 could survive for more than 17 days on a surface.  +(It just shows) that the viral RNA is detectable for at least 17 days,+ he said.  +That+s like saying that detecting DNA on a piece of hair post-mortem means (the) person is alive.+  HOW VIRUSES WORK  Under a microscope, coronaviruses like the one causing the Covid-19 disease appear spherical, with a +crown+ of spikes on their surface.  In its centre, encased in a lipid membrane, is its genetic material: a single-strand RNA genome.  For it to infect its host, this structure has to be intact, said Prof Wang.  Various measures, such as exposing the virus to heat or through the use of disinfectants, break this structure, rendering the virus impotent and incapable of infecting its host.  For instance, the spikes on the virus+ surface are susceptible to being destroyed, or denatured, by heat or the sun+s ultra-violet rays. When these spikes are destroyed, viruses lose their ability to latch on to a human host cell.  Similarly, disinfectants and alcohol-based sanitisers help to make a virus unviable by breaking the membrane.  Prof Wang said current tests for the virus make use of a molecular biology process known as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which helps to determine if the sample contains any detectable genetic material of the coronavirus.  Related Story Interactive: What we know so far about the coronavirus  He said: +The PCR test zooms into the genetic material. So we have to differentiate between a live virus, which has an intact structure, with its lipid membrane intact, that can transmit and cause disease, versus a situation where you have only a little bit of genetic material left.+  He added: +In the latter, we can still get a PCR positive, but the virus is gone.+  LISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST","43":"SINGAPORE - As a scientist who studies infectious diseases, Professor Wang Linfa knows all too well the importance of social distancing and personal hygiene to not becoming sick during a pandemic.  In fact, the director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Medical School has been practising such measures long before the Government started issuing recommendations for people to keep their distance from others, so as to reduce the chances of more people being infected with the virus causing Covid-19.  For example, after visiting Wuhan in China - the first epicentre of the current outbreak - as part of a team of scientists learning more about the virus in mid-January, Prof Wang put himself on home quarantine even though there was no requirement for him to do so then.  He was a member of the emergency committee convened by the World Health Organisation that debated the organisation+s stance on the coronavirus during the early stages of the outbreak.  Even now, he is also trying to put into practice new habits - such as avoiding contact with people, even family members, and reducing time spent outside his home or laboratory.  +I haven+t hugged my daughter in two months,+ he told The Straits Times on Monday (March 23), after a panel discussion hosted by the newspaper on how people were the first line of defence against the spread of Covid-19.  Prof Wang said that life, as well as his work in the laboratory, had to go on even during an outbreak. And to ensure that the work goes on, it was important that his team takes the appropriate safety precautions.  Prof Wang has for decades been studying bat-borne viruses by scrutinising their genetic code and the virus-bat interaction, among other aspects of biology. The coronavirus causing Covid-19 is believed to have originated from bats.  He said: +If one member of my team gets infected, everyone has to be quarantined, and all the tests we+re doing have to stop for at least two weeks.+  While there are business continuity plans in place, with researchers divided into two teams, it was still important for them to take care of their health because one team in quarantine would mean half the manpower left to do the research, he said.  Prof Wang added: +I beg my team... I mean, they are young people, they+re working day and night, and they ask me if they can go out for a drink. But I tell them, +just drink by yourself+.+  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Prof Wang was one of four panellists involved in the discussion on how personal hygiene and cleanliness were key to tackling the current outbreak.  The other three were Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources; Mr Tai Ji Choong, director of the National Environment Agency+s Department of Public Cleanliness, and Mr Edward D+Silva, chairman of the Public Hygiene Council.  During the discussion, the panellists emphasised how people were the first line of defence against the further spread of the virus, with social grace and personal cleanliness now no longer just a matter of preference or being civic-minded.  Mr Masagos, who also chairs the newly formed SG Clean Taskforce that aims to raise hygiene standards at the national level, stressed that other measures such as border controls and quarantine would not be as effective in combating the outbreak if personal hygiene was neglected.  The virus is spread mainly through respiratory droplets.  Despite stepped-up cleaning and disinfection routines by premise managers, panellists said individuals could also reduce the chances of the virus spreading by picking up after themselves.  This includes disposing of used pieces of tissue paper - or small biohazards, as Mr Masagos calls them - instead of leaving them for others to do so, and returning trays and used cutlery, so that there is less chance of the contaminants coming into contact with others.

When approved, this would be about the fastest test out there for Covid-19.  They hope to submit the test for approval in a month+s time. The test looks for the genetic material of the virus in a patient+s secretions collected from a swab.  This sample is then put in a portable device that will give the result in about five to 10 minutes, using an extremely rapid amplification method that they have named Cepat.  +We have done some preliminary clinical validation at the KK Women+s and Children+s Hospital using real patients+ samples, and found the test to be very sensitive and accurate,+ said Prof Ying.  Once it is approved, the technology can be used to make such kits for use in hospitals. It will also be adapted for use in general practitioner clinics, said Prof Ying.  She and her team are among the researchers here and around the world who are racing to come up with point-of-care tests that can tell you if you have Covid-19 much faster than the current standard lab test. The challenge, Prof Ying said, is to develop rapid and accurate diagnostics that can be done without the use of expensive machines.  As the pandemic grows, the spotlight is increasingly falling on testing as a way to contain the spread - for the lack of it has potentially been hiding a large number of cases.  The World Health Organisation has emphasised the need to +test, test, test+, as it allows cases to be picked up earlier and promptly isolated, before they spread it to more people.    Professor Jackie Ying (fourth from left), the head of A*Star+s NanoBio Lab, said she and her team of scientists have been working tirelessly for around six weeks to come up with a rapid test that can tell if a person has Covid-19 in as little as five minutes, after A*Star+s chief executive Frederick Chew (third from left) gave them the challenge of coming up with rapid tests for Covid-19. The test looks for the genetic material of the virus in a patient+s secretions collected from a swab. PHOTO: COURTESY OF JACKIE YING    Some countries are able to do widespread testing; others, like the United States, are experiencing a shortage of tests.  In Singapore, testing started in January at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, where the National Public Health Laboratory is based. By the end of January, all of Singapore+s public hospitals could test for Covid-19, said the group director of medicine at the National University Health System, Professor Dale Fisher. Singapore then tested anyone coming to a hospital with a respiratory illness and anyone who had been in contact with a Covid-19 patient.  Related Story Drugs for other uses being trialled to help patients  +Less than 1 per cent of tests are positive, which reflects the large number being done,+ he said.  These are the standard lab tests that look for the genetic material of the virus in the patient+s secretions, often collected with a nasopharyngeal swab.  The test takes at least two to three hours to show results and requires the use of specialised machines. If samples need to be transported, the turnaround time is even longer.  These tests work by first converting the coronavirus+ RNA to DNA in a method known as reverse transcription (RT). Then, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique is used to amplify the genetic material of the virus so that it can be easily detected.  It is called the RT-PCR test. +It is essentially a molecular photocopier. PCR was invented in 1984, and even in today+s machines, about 60 per cent of the time is spent waiting for the PCR machine to heat up and cool down,+ said Prof Ying.  The latest invention by her and PhD student Muhammad Nadjad Abdul Rahim is a new method to amplify specific DNA\/RNA at a single temperature.  Just like PCR, their method can +photocopy+ the genetic material of the virus millions of times. The difference in their new method is that they can hit a rate of millions of copies within a minute.  One key reason is that unlike PCR, their approach does not require any heating and cooling between each controlled amplification step. This is enabled by a special enzyme developed in Prof Ying+s lab.  Prof Ying said she and her team of scientists have been working tirelessly for around six weeks to come up with the fast test, after A*Star+s chief executive Frederick Chew gave them the challenge of coming up with rapid tests for Covid-19.  Earlier, A*Star had developed PCR test kits for use here and overseas, and has passed the baton to local firm MiRXES, which can mass produce them.  Another local biotech firm Veredus Laboratories developed a three-hour PCR test kit that is being used at checkpoints here.  Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, the programme leader for infectious diseases at the National University of Singapore+s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said that there are many diagnostic tests and kits being developed in China and the US, as well as those by local companies such as MiRXES and Veredus Laboratories, and it is a matter of time before the ones from overseas are available here.  US firm Cepheid has received emergency authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration for its rapid molecular test, which can be used at the point of care for patients and gives a result in 45 minutes. It makes use of machines to run the test, which are already available in Singapore hospitals.  Other types of tests done to find Covid-19 in patients are the sero-logical tests. These look for immunoglobulins, which are the antibodies made by the immune system to fight the virus - in patients+ blood.  These antibodies take a few days to show though, and will not appear in the early stage of the disease. Hence, a blood test will not detect Covid-19 if someone has just been infected with it.  Duke-NUS Medical School was the first in the world to develop a serological test that was put to good use last month to trace two people who were the source of infection of two clusters here.  The two had mild symptoms, were not hospitalised and had recovered, but the test found they had antibodies against the coronavirus.  As serological tests pick up such mild cases, they can be done to ascertain the extent of community spread, as well as asymptomatic spread.  Such tests, however, take several hours to show results. Fast test kits solve the problem but it is very important to note the sensitivity of the tests, said Prof Ying.  There is little point using a very fast test kit when it cannot detect the virus in you most of the time. Or, worse, it may tell you that you are not sick, even though you are infected with Covid-19.  The latter is what is called a false negative, and it can happen, for instance, when the test kit is unable to pick up the virus in a person with a low viral load.  People infected with Covid-19 are believed to shed large quantities of the virus early in their illness (high viral load) and less later on.  Hence, it would be best if a fast test can pick up the infection from a patient at various stages of the disease, regardless of whether he has a high or low viral load, said Prof Ying.  On Saturday, the US Food and Drug Administration said it is already beginning to see unauthorised fraudulent test kits that are being marketed to test for Covid-19 in the home.  Fraudulent health claims, tests and products may keep some patients from seeking care or delay necessary medical treatment, it said. +When you run a test, you must know what you are testing for,+ said Prof Ying.  An RT-PCR test should be able to detect the disease in someone who is in the earlier stage of the disease, when he is shedding more of the virus, and, therefore, likely more infectious.  On the other hand, a serological test can find antibodies in someone who is at the late stage or recovered, when he is shedding less or none of the virus, she said.  +This crisis has forced Singapore to re-examine whether we have the ability to do the various things needed to fight it and we do,+ she said. +We can do the science and we can also develop our own tests.+","51":"Sweeping measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak in Singapore were announced on Tuesday (March 24) by the Government\u2019s multi-ministry task force tackling the outbreak.  These include the closure of entertainment outlets and limiting gatherings outside of work and school to 10 people or fewer.  With the 49 new cases reported on Tuesday, the total number of imported cases here is 326.  This is nearly three in five of all 558 confirmed coronavirus cases here.  The risk is expected to heighten in the coming days as more Singaporeans return from abroad.  All returnees from Britain and the United States will have to serve their mandatory 14-day stay-home notice in dedicated hotels to reduce transmission.  Here is a look at the recent measures:    From March 26, 11.59pm  Gatherings outside of work and school limited to 10 persons or fewer. People must keep at least 1m apart in non-transient gatherings (for example, a yoga class).  Bars and entertainment venues, such as nightclubs, discos, cinemas, theatres and karaoke outlets, will be closed until April 30. This might be extended if the situation does not improve.  Malls, museums and attractions, where contact is more transient, may remain open. But they must abide by the following:  Reduce the number of people at any one time and keep to no more than one person per 16 sq m of usable space. This is about the size of a Housing Board flat bathroom. Groups must not exceed 10 persons. Indoor and outdoor shows within attractions will be suspended, as will museum group tours and open atrium sales events. Make sure there is at least 1m of physical space between patrons, including at queues and waiting areas. They should try to offer services by appointment or digitally. Crowds should be quickly cleared. Places that cannot meet these requirements must be closed. If found to be a place of transmission because they did not adhere to these measures, they may face additional penalties.    Centre-based tuition and enrichment classes will be suspended from March 26, 11.59pm, in Singapore as part of the measures to fight the coronavirus outbreak.

Religious services and congregations will be suspended. Places of worship may open for private worship and essential rites but group sizes should be kept to 10 persons or fewer at any one time.  Events and mass gatherings, including conferences, concerts and sporting events, must be deferred or cancelled, regardless of size.  All social gatherings and events with more than 10 people at a time, such as private birthday parties and weddings, are discouraged.  Funerals and wakes should be limited to family members, with gatherings of 10 people or fewer at a time.  From March 27  Singapore residents and long-term pass holders who disregard travel advisories and leave Singapore will have to pay unsubsidised rates at public hospitals if they are admitted for suspected Covid-19 and develop symptoms within 14 days of their return.  Residents will also not be able to claim from MediShield Life or Integrated Shield Plans for these treatments at public and private hospitals.  Any work pass holder or his dependant who leaves Singapore will be deprioritised for entry approval.  For seniors  Suspension of activities is extended to April 30. Seniors are urged to avoid social gatherings and crowded places, and to go out only for essential purposes like work and to buy food.  Returning Singaporeans, residents and long-term work pass holders  Those coming back from the US and Britain will be transported from the airport to selected hotels to serve their 14-day stay home notice (SHN), with effect from March 25, 11.59pm. They will not be allowed to leave their rooms.  Those who have already returned and are serving their SHN at home may apply to stay in these hotels. They can call 6812-5555.  Pre-school and primary school pupils living with anyone who returns from any country from March 25, 11.59pm, will be placed on 14-day leave of absence (LOA).  Pre-school and primary school pupils living with anyone who returns to Singapore from Britain, the US or Asean countries on or after March 14, will be placed on LOA.

LISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST","54":"SINGAPORE - New measures to help businesses cope with the coronavirus outbreak have been rolled out by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).  In a statement on Tuesday (March 24) MOM said that, with immediate effect, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will get a three-month extension for paying the levy for the foreign workers they hire. This is expected to give these companies more flexibility with managing their cash flows.  Another measure announced is an up to 90-day waiver on levies for foreign workers on overseas leave. This also takes effect immediately.  The last measure is a refund on the +man year entitlement+ for foreign workers in construction firms.  Under the man-year entitlement framework, these firms can pay lower levies for a certain number of foreign workers, depending on the project. The lower levies are paid monthly for a year.  With the refund scheme, the lower levy for a foreign worker is not forfeited if the worker leaves, or is unable to work. Instead, the unused lower levy benefit can be used for another worker.  Companies can apply to the Building and Construction Authority for the refund scheme from April 1 for a period of six months.  MOM also urged firms with extra manpower to give priority to locals in keeping their jobs. These firms should also allow their foreign workers to be transferred to other firms facing a manpower shortage.  On the extension of the SME foreign worker levy payment, about 60,000 firms can benefit from this relief measure and it will apply to levies incurred in 2020.  SMEs will have up to five months to pay for the foreign worker levy from the month it is incurred. Currently, the foreign worker levy incurred is due by the 14th of the following month.  Employers who do not make the payment on time will have their new and renewal work pass applications rejected. If they cannot make payment on time for two consecutive months, all existing work passes under that employer will be revoked.  MOM urged companies that benefit from the extension to keep their existing workers and not employ new foreign workers. The ministry will not allow new applications of work passes from these firms, although it will accept renewals.  The late payment penalty of 2 per cent a month will still apply to levy payments which are extended.  For the 90-day levy waiver for foreign workers on overseas leave, this was extended due to tighter border restrictions and difficulties workers may face when returning to Singapore.  It applies to firms that send their foreign workers home from now until the end of this year.  The current levy waiver for up to 60 days applies to foreign workers who go on overseas home leave for at least seven consecutive days.  The refund scheme for construction companies that allows them to reallocate lower levies comes after feedback from the Singapore Contractors Association Limited that construction firms are facing disruptions due to delays in overseas supplies and travel restrictions on foreign construction workers.  As a result of these disruptions, construction firms are unable to fully utilise the year-long lower levies under the man-year entitlement framework.  This means higher costs to contractors who will have to hire foreign workers on higher levy rates.  But with the new refund scheme, companies can use the remaining unused lower levy benefits for new workers or existing ones.  Following the Ministry of Health+s advisory against all travel abroad on March 18, MOM said it would be limiting the number of entry approvals for work pass holders to enter Singapore.  MOM said that a very small number of these work pass holders would be allowed to enter, with priority given to essential services like healthcare and transport.  With this, the ministry advised employers to defer plans to bring in new foreign workers from overseas until the coronavirus situation stabilises. If foreign workers are still needed, they should use foreign workers already in Singapore.  If the foreign workers are not needed, employers should allow them to be transferred to other employers who face a manpower shortage in the same sector.  Firms in manufacturing and services can approach the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) for assistance under the SBF ManpowerConnect scheme while construction firms can use the online Foreign Construction Worker Directory System to match workers with prospective employers.  More information on all the measures is available on the MOM website.","60":"SINGAPORE - The Republic has confirmed 49 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday (March 24) as students and workers continued to return home in droves from abroad.

They are the Singapore American School (SAS) and the United World College of South East Asia (UWCSEA), with each having three parents diagnosed with the virus.  SAS\u2019 superintendent Tom Boasberg said all its three parents are hospitalised and are in good condition. None of them had visited the school.  \u201cIn all cases, the parents and their family members have fully followed Ministry of Health restrictions, including staying home immediately upon learning of the family member\u2019s confirmed case,\u201d said Mr Boasberg.  At the UWCSEA, which has two campuses in Dover and Tampines, three parents of its students are confirmed cases. None of its students and staff have the virus.  \u201cNone of these parents came to campus or attended a school event in the weeks before they were diagnosed with Covid-19,\u201d a spokesman said.  Messages have been recently circulating online about a recent gathering attended by SAS students, that has links to one of the parents who is a confirmed case.  In response to queries from The Straits Times, Mr Boasberg said the parent in question was found to have the virus on March 15 and he had been labelled an imported case.  Travelling alone, the man contracted the virus while in a European country, which was at that time not one of the countries that Singapore had advised against travel to.  He returned to Singapore on March 13 and sought medical advice the next day for the mild fever he was experiencing. The doctor sent him back home to rest.  Mr Boasberg said a swab test done on March 14 confirmed that the parent has the coronavirus and he was admitted to a hospital the next day.  Related Story Coronavirus: ECDA orders Fengshan PCF Sparkletots centre to close for 2 weeks after teacher tests positive  The day before his diagnosis, one of his children, who attends SAS, was present at an event hosted by another student and came into contact with several other SAS students.  But Mr Boasberg said the father was neither at the event nor at school, and had no contact with students other than his child after returning from overseas.  +As soon as the father was diagnosed, this student stayed home and had no contact with other students,\u201d Mr Boasberg added.  The school, which is situated in Woodlands and has a 4,000 student body, is currently on a spring break that began last Saturday and will last until Sunday (March 29).  Mr Boasberg said the school is taking advantage of the break to conduct deep cleaning of its campus, having already stepped up cleaning efforts in the past two months.  The school had initiated home-based learning last Thursday and Friday, before the spring break started, with students staying at home while teachers went to school to give virtual lessons.  It will continue conducting distance learning for another week after spring break, while monitoring the situation in Singapore. Unless circumstances change, classes will resume at the school\u2019s campus on April 6.  Said Mr Boasberg: \u201cOur overriding priority in our decisions is the health and safety of our community. We have seen that the vast majority of the recent uptick in cases in Singapore is from overseas returnees.  \u201cWe are aware that local schools in Singapore resumed classes on Monday, March 23.

Other international schools have also switched to remote learning, or brought forward their spring breaks, in a bid to keep students at home.  The UWCSEA\u2019s term break, which was scheduled to start on Friday, began last Wednesday instead. Lessons will resume on April 6.  Said the spokesman: \u201cThe decision as to whether this is in the classrooms on campus, or via remote learning will be made closer to the date and communicated to our community directly.  \u201cWe are fully prepared for either eventuality and are currently working to support students and families impacted by announcements made by external examining bodies.\u201d  In the light of the coronavirus outbreak, the International Baccalaureate has scrapped its examinations in May, affecting students in schools here like Tanglin Trust School and Dulwich College Singapore.  Exam board Cambridge Assessment International Education also cancelled its International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) exams in May and June because of worldwide school closures.  Tanglin Trust School, which has 2,800 students, has no confirmed cases among students or staff. The school started conducting e-learning last Thursday (March 19), and will continue until Friday, March 27. It will then close for a two-week holiday and classes will resume on April 13.  Mr Tom Evans, the school\u2019s director of marketing and communications, cited concerns about the recent travel histories of people connected with the school returning from abroad and said the school experienced operational difficulties caused by increasing travel restrictions.  A large number of people within the extended Tanglin community returned to Singapore from abroad in mid-March, including family members returning from work trips and students returning from universities and schools in Britain, said Mr Evans.  \u201cThe inability to be certain of people\u2019s travel histories within households was a significant factor in our deliberations,\u201d he said, adding that staff were concerned about their own health and there was a spike in student absenteeism.  It was becoming extremely difficult for senior leaders to carry out their duties in the daily administration of the school, and the closure of the border with Malaysia impacted many of our operations team members, he said.

Other international schools are continuing lessons as per normal, while stepping up precautionary measures.  Mr Christian Soulard, principal of International French School (Singapore), said it has \u201cno plans to close at this time\u201d, but has put in place extra hygiene procedures like twice-daily temperature-taking, and extra cleaning and disinfecting on school premises.  \u201cStudents are regularly reminded to practise good personal hygiene habits and social distancing. All extra-curricular activities have been postponed and large events and overseas trips, as well as day trips and excursions, have been cancelled,\u201d he said.  To be prepared, the school is conducting a trial for its home-based learning on Tuesday and Wednesday for students and teachers.  \u201cThis test will allow us to test various IT infrastructure, learning and communication tools while provide students and teachers with useful practice and experience,\u201d said Mr Soulard.  Fashion and lifestyle curator Samia Khan, 43, whose two boys attend SAS, said: \u201cIt\u2019s very unfortunate that the imported cases came from parents who had travelled, so it\u2019s timely to limit the exposure of students during these two weeks.\u201d  Image consultant Sujata Kumar, 41, whose twin girls go to UWCSEA in Dover, said the school has been proactive and transparent in sharing information about the situation.  +The spike in imported cases is a wake-up call, and in an international school environment, you\u2019d never know where families have travelled and if they are taking necessary precautions.\u201d  Additional reporting by Jolene Ang","67":"SINGAPORE - What does clearing your tray have to do with fighting the coronavirus? And has the Covid-19 outbreak helped in fighting climate change?  The Straits Times sat down with four experts - Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli, Public Hygiene Council chairman Edward D+Silva, the director of the National Environment Agency+s (NEA) department of public cleanliness, Mr Tai Ji Choong, and director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Wang Linfa - to find out more.  Q: What does tray return have to do with my health?  Professor Wang: Infectious materials are living organisms that thrive on food. The longer you leave contaminants on the table, the higher the chances of someone coming in contact with them.  Q: What is one of the worst hygiene habits people here have?  Mr Masagos: Until recently, even myself, after I eat in a hawker centre, I will put my tissue paper inside (my bowl) and I think that+s not littering, it+s just keeping it away from the floor and so forth. But I+m beginning to recognise that these are also what I call little biohazards that you leave on the table sometimes, or even in your bowl.  Eat on a tray so that if the food falls out of your bowl, it falls on the tray, and then when you return the tray, the table is clean for the next person. At the same time, the cleaners do not have to clean up after you.  Q: Is +I cannot find a bin+ a valid excuse for littering?  Mr Tai: Well, just counting the public bins that are owned by NEA, we already have over 11,000 bins - and this doesn+t include the town council bins.  The shopping malls have their own bins. The MRT stations have their own bins. So actually Singapore has no shortage of bins. And the bins are actually within very easy reach.  So there are really no reasons for a person to say +I cannot find a bin, so I just drop (my litter).+  Related Story Keeping clean the first line of defence against coronavirus: Expert panel  Q: What changes are being made to Singapore+s hawker centres to encourage cleaner practices?  Mr D+Silva: We realise that when customers finish their food, if you want them to clear their trays, the tray return facility should be as close as possible to them so that they don+t have to walk a long way. These are just behavioural patterns. So I think this is something which we can learn and we can improve.  The cleaning operators will have to also upskill themselves, and we need to see how we can help them mechanise to some extent, and at the same time educate and promote awareness among their own cleaners... (Cleaners) can do a much better, efficient job if they are doing things other than just clearing your trays. So I think these are little things that we can tweak in the months ahead.  Q: How do cleaning agents and disinfectants help fight the virus?  Prof Wang: The virus has a lipid membrane outside, and for the virus to remain intact, it needs to maintain the lipid.  Many of the cleaning agents can dissolve this lipid, so that+s why it+s very important that we wash our hands either with soap or a sanitiser or 70 per cent ethanol. All of these will not only clean the environment in the general sort of sense but, more specifically for Covid-19, you can actually disrupt the virus and then prevent its transmission.  Q: Can Covid-19 help lower global emissions and fight climate change?  Mr Masagos: Even if there is a positive impact on climate change, the cost to lives is huge, and I don+t think we should be celebrating this.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Related Story Five lessons from fighting Covid-19  Related Story Drill into what makes people socially responsible  We have set the world on this journey of reducing emissions and then getting ready to adapt.

At the same time, we look to new opportunities and new solutions. Fossil fuel versus, say, hydrogen.  All these are very great ideas that we should not dismiss and stop talking about.","68":"SINGAPORE - In the ongoing battle to contain the spread of Covid-19, every measure will help to prevent its spread, from border controls to social distancing recommendations and even personal hygiene habits, experts said on Monday (March 23).  +Social distancing, personal hygiene, (and) business continuity plans can all help to reduce R0 (R-naught) to less than one,+ said infectious diseases expert Wang Linfa, during a panel discussion hosted by The Straits Times on the importance of personal hygiene amid the Covid-19 outbreak.  R0 refers to the basic reproduction number. It indicates the natural spread of the virus, said Professor Wang, who is director of the programme in emerging infectious diseases at Duke-NUS Medical School.  If R0 is less than one, it means each existing infection causes fewer than one new infection. In this case, the disease will decline and eventually die out, but if it is greater than one, it will probably keep spreading.  Countries, including Singapore, are taking measures to drive R0 to less than one, said Prof Want.  +I think so far we+re doing pretty good, but I think we need to really keep it up,+ he said, adding that everyone, from the individual to the Government, could help to draw down R0 for Covid-19.  Prof Wang said the R0 for Covid-19 is estimated to be between two and three, similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). In comparison, the R0 for measles is about 12.  Prof Wang said bringing R0 down would also help to +flatten the epidemic curve+ by preventing the number of infected cases from surging suddenly.  The epidemic curve is an n-shaped curve that is used to visualise when new cases happen and at what speed during a virus outbreak.  Said Prof Wang: +If you let the natural R0 play out, the hospitals will collapse because there+s not enough beds, not enough ventilators. So the strategy is to flatten the curve so that, for example, you have severe cases of 10 per day rather than a hundred or a thousand per day.+  Prof Wang was one of four panellists who took part in Monday+s discussion.  The other three included Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli, who is head of the new SG Clean task force; Mr Edward D+Silva, chairman of the Public Hygiene Council; and Mr Tai Ji Choong, director of the National Environment Agency+s Department of Public Cleanliness.  While other measures - such as adhering to social distancing recommendations and staying home if one feels ill - are important, Mr Masagos said that it was also important for people to practise good cleanliness habits.  Related Story Keeping clean the first line of defence against coronavirus: Expert panel  +Public hygiene, personal hygiene is our first defence. And it+s not just our defence against Covid-19 today, but against other breakouts that we cannot foresee in future,+ he said.  Asked if travelling on public transport was safe, given the recent recommendations for people to keep their distance from others, Mr Masagos said the risk of exposure depended on a number of factors, including duration and intensity of exposure, and the density of the crowd.  Huge crowds, such as the religious gathering at a mosque in Malaysia, was one example of high-density situations that should be avoided, said Mr Masagos, who is also Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs.  +The other is intensity - how close are you to the person, how much you+re interacting with the person,+ he said, citing the cluster of Covid-19 patients who were linked to a dinner event at Safra Jurong.  Contact-tracing efforts had found that the patients linked to the event had also spent time together outside the dinner, including going for karaoke sessions together.  Duration of exposure is also important, said Mr Masagos, adding that the rough guideline is to keep exposure to under about 30 minutes.  Said Mr Masagos: +Therefore, if in any social setting, if you can ensure that you have short duration, you have low intensity and you have low density, then you are safer than not.+  Prof Wang added that in such an outbreak, there is no fail-safe measure and that there is a risk of exposure in any closed environment, including in an elevator.  However, he said: +But if you have to take public transport, the chance in Singapore of getting on a contaminated MRT, for example, is very low.+  Said Prof Wang: +But even if the hand is contaminated, you+re not going to be infected. It+s only when you rub your nose or your eyes. You just need to be cautious that when you go out in public... Then as soon as you get to the office or home, wash your hands. I think that+s the best you can do.+","71":"SINGAPORE - Nine in 10 imported Covid-19 cases in Singapore between Wednesday (March 18) and Friday last week did not show symptoms, like fever, when they had passed through the border checkpoints.  As a result, the cases were detected only later on, the Health Ministry said on Monday (March 23) in response to queries.  It explained that about 90 per cent of the imported cases reported in Singapore during the three-day period saw a doctor at a hospital or general practitioner+s clinic after they returned home.  +They had not displayed symptoms when at the checkpoints,+ it added.  Travellers into Singapore have to walk past thermal scanners, which would help identify those who are feverish. Those who are observed to be so, or have other respiratory symptoms will be required to do a Covid-19 swab test.  Singapore had 119 cases altogether in those three days, with 87 of them being imported cases, the ministry+s figures show.  There have been mounting concerns that people with coronavirus may not show symptoms, such as fever, dry cough and shortness of breath.  Scientists are calling for urgent studies to determine the proportion of people with coronavirus who show no, or delayed, symptoms, amid fears that the number of silent carriers may be greater than previously thought.  The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that as many as one-third of the people who test positive show delayed symptoms or none at all, citing classified data from the Chinese government.  In line with stiffer border controls to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, travellers entering Singapore, regardless of where they come from, have been given a 14-day stay-home notice since 11.59pm on Friday. It is mandatory even for those who are well.  The ministry had also said on Sunday that an additional precaution will be taken for those who come into close contact with a confirmed case on their flight back.  Related Story Coronavirus: All travellers arriving in Singapore must submit health declaration from Friday  They will be quarantined.  A quarantine order requires the person to stay put in a dedicated room with a toilet.  It is the strictest among the measures and is given to those who are, or are suspected of being, a carrier of the coronavirus.  In contrast, people serving a stay-home notice will not require a dedicated room and toilet, but they must stay home at all times.  Border control measures in Singapore will be intensified from 11.59pm on Monday (March 23) in a further effort to reduce the risk of importing coronavirus cases.  All short-term visitors, including tourists, will be barred from entering or transiting through Singapore.  Also, work-pass holders and their dependants will be allowed to return to Singapore only if they are employed in sectors that provide essential services, such as healthcare and transport.","72":"SINGAPORE - Enhanced social distancing measures were announced last Friday (March 13), gatherings are now being limited to 250 people at a time. Some people have asked if it is still safe to go swimming, in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Q: Is it safe to go swimming during this period? Can the virus be transmitted through water?  A: It is known that the virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets and saliva, but there is currently no evidence suggesting that the virus can be spread through water, hence making swimming one of the safer sporting activities.  Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam also suggests that it is generally safe to go swimming, as the water and chlorine within swimming pools could help to kill the virus.  People, however, should be mindful of their interactions with others outside the water.  Professor Paul Tambyah from the Department of Medicine at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine noted media reports about an infection cluster in a South Korean church that sprayed saltwater in its churchgoers\u2019 mouths. However, this incident does not provide clear evidence suggesting that the virus can be transmitted via water, he said.  Prof Tambyah also said that it is not known as to how long the virus can survive in plain water, and there have been no cases of viral transmission through plain water.  Thus, citing the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, Prof Tambyah concludes that recreational activities in water is generally safe.  Q: What precautions should one take outside the swimming pool?  A: Individuals should practise good basic hygiene by refraining from sharing towels, and showering before entering the pool, said Prof Tambyah. He also cautioned that individuals should avoid public pools when they are unwell.  It should be noted that those given stay-at-home orders should remain home at all times. If they leave their homes, they will be guilty of breaking the law.  As common facilities such as locker rooms and showers may be crowded, showering at home could be a safer precautionary measure.  Dr Leong also advised individuals to avoid lingering around the pool area, and to go home directly after swimming.  Those who need to use public shower facilities should opt for a single shower cubicle, he added  SportsSG has also regulated the number of people using the Active SG swimming pools at any one point in time, and closed off children pools until further notice.  These precautionary measures were implemented in line with the advisory issued by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on March 13, which said that sports centres with indoor facilities should limit the number of patrons and introduce physical separation measures, on top of increased cleaning frequency and issuing advisories to reduce unnecessary contact.  Related Story Coronavirus: Physical distancing measures at public sports facilities face hurdles  Q: Are lane segregation measures introduced effective against the spread of the virus?  A: Lane segregation has been implemented at running tracks and swimming pools, in line with the precautionary measures that came into force on March 15.  This means that several running lanes are cordoned off at various stadiums, restricting runners to a few available lanes.  ActiveSG swimming pools have placed lane ropes restricting swimming to the length of the pool. Certain lanes have been allocated for swimming classes and lap swimming, while the remaining are available to the rest of the swimmers.  Experts have warned that while such social distancing measures make sense, people should still be wary of possible overcrowding situations.","73":"SINGAPORE - While the Republic continues to ramp up its fight against the coronavirus outbreak, it cannot drop its guard against its old foe, dengue, said Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli on Monday (March 23) at a panel discussion organised by The Straits Times on combating the spread of Covid-19 here.  As of Sunday, more than 4,000 people here had been infected with dengue fever, double the number of cases reported for the same period last year.  Worse still, said Mr Masagos, the strain of dengue threatening Singapore today, DENV-3, is one which many here do not have immunity against.  There are four dengue serotypes, with DENV-1 and DENV-2 being behind the outbreaks here. DENV-2 has been the dominant strain since 2016.  Mr Masagos warned: +The last time we had the DENV-3 outbreak was 30 years ago, which means that there+s a generation of us who do not have the antibodies or the immunity against (it)... it+s certainly something to cause alarm.+  He added: +We hope that as much as we are worried about Covid-19, we must not lose sight of ensuring that... we do not become lax.  +Yes, we start washing our hands - it+s fantastic, we don+t leave tissues on the table, but please continue to do the things that we have always been doing year after year to bring down and to keep suppressing the breeding of mosquitoes because that+s the only and best defence against dengue transmission.+  In response to the grim dengue outlook here, the National Environment Agency (NEA) had brought forward the launch of its annual dengue prevention campaign, which typically begins in April or May, to Sunday.  Also on Monday+s panel were Professor Wang Linfa, director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Medical School, Mr Edward D+Silva, chairman of the Public Hygiene Council, and Mr Tai Ji Choong, director of NEA+s Department of Public Cleanliness.  Prof Wang said that those who had previously been exposed to the DENV-1 and DENV-2 strains of dengue are at higher risk of getting a more severe infection from the DENV-3 strain due to a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement.  This occurs when antibodies that are already present in a person from a previous dengue infection bind to a new infectious dengue particle, but instead of neutralising the virus, help it infect the patient more efficiently.  Related Story 2 coronavirus patients test positive for dengue despite not having the mosquito-borne disease  Related Story Singapore faces dengue threat from emergence of little-seen strain  And while there is as yet no scientific evidence linking dengue and Covid-19, it is possible that a dengue infection might weaken a person+s immune system and make one more susceptible to Covid-19, said Prof Wang.  +You just want to keep healthy and avoid any infection, whether it+s dengue or Covid-19... These are two different viruses and two different approaches. But the principle is the same, it+s every citizen+s responsibility,+ he said.  Mr Masagos said: +The point is we don+t want to have two crises to fight.+  He added: +In Singapore, dengue is here to stay. Covid-19 is here but will hopefully go away. We must therefore not lose our sight on something which is also as dangerous, will also cause losses.+","78":"SINGAPORE - Twenty-nine patients recovering from Covid-19 were transferred from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases to a ward at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Orchard Road on Monday (March 23).  The move is aimed at freeing up capacity at public hospitals so they can take care of the more seriously ill Covid-19 patients.  The transferred patients were ones who were no longer sick, or needed less medical care, but were still shedding the virus.  They will be discharged once they are confirmed to be clear of the virus and no longer risk spreading the disease.  Mount Elizabeth Hospital is the first of four Parkway hospitals to take in Covid-19 patients from the public sector, said Dr Noel Yeo, senior vice-president of Parkway\u2019s hospital operations in Singapore.  The number of new infections here, especially imported ones, has been fairly high as residents return from high-infection countries.  There are now more than 300 Covid-19 patients hospitalised here.  The Health Ministry said that it expected the number of Covid-19 cases in Singapore to increase, and had plans in place to deal with increased demand for hospital and clinical services.  It has activated a collaboration between public and private hospitals to transfer well and stable Covid-19 patients to selected private hospitals so that capacity in the public sector may be freed for the management of more severe cases.  Over the past three days, the National Centre for Infectious Diseases had transferred 20 patients to Concord International Hospital, in addition to 29 patients to Mount Elizabeth Hospital, via dedicated ambulances, it said in a statement on Monday.  Obstetricians at Parkway East had expressed concerns that the ward for the Covid-19 patients is on the same floor as the maternity ward.  However, Dr Yeo said: \u201cThe same stringent safety protocols and precautionary measures will apply for these new patients, who will be housed in a single ward at the hospital.\u201d  Related Story SGH sets up fever screening area in carpark as cases spike  These patients will not be allowed to leave the ward, nor allowed any visitors. All staff working in areas where the patients are must don protective apparel.  He added that the areas these patients had passed through during the transfer will be thoroughly cleaned and sanitised.  Dr Yeo said: \u201cWe have been working closely with the Ministry of Health on joining the national effort against Covid-19, and how private sector resources may be utilised to alleviate the load on public healthcare institutions.\u201d  He hopes other private sector hospitals will also \u201cplay their part to complement these efforts\u201d.  Last week, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said Singapore has sufficient healthcare facilities and workers to cope with the current number of Covid-19 patients.  He said there are also contingency plans if numbers go up.  These include opening up more wards in public hospitals as well as using quarantine facilities for recovering patients.  MOH said on Monday that there are plans to further collaborate with private hospitals to manage Covid-19 cases, as well as patients with other conditions, to free up capacity in the public sector.","86":"Children appear to be asymptomatic or less likely to be sick from Covid-19 than adults, which is why there is no real reason to close schools for now, says Professor Dale Fisher, group director of medicine at the National University Health System and chair of the World Health Organisation+s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.  He shares more.  Q Why do children seem to be less affected by Covid-19 than adults?  A We know that there are other diseases where children are not affected as much. For instance, chicken pox is a much milder illness in children than in adults.  And a child with Hepatitis A (a viral liver disease) probably does not have symptoms, but they might have antibodies if you test them, whereas adults with Hepatitis A will develop fever and jaundice.  So, we know that children and adults have a different sort of immune system. The children could be - for reasons we do not yet understand - less likely to have symptoms.  If studies done to find out if children have antibodies to Covid-19 show that there are a lot of asymptomatic children, it will prove - but it will not tell us why - that children are getting infected but not showing symptoms.  Q Should we worry about children passing Covid-19 to the elderly?  A That is another question we do not yet know the answer to. However, if they are asymptomatic, they are less likely to do so.  In fact, a lot of the swabs that we have taken from family clusters have shown that while the parents might have had the disease and had symptoms, the children are completely well, even though they tested positive.  We have no evidence that the child in those family clusters was the first person to get it.  If you are asymptomatic, you are much less likely to spread it because you are not coughing, you are not making the droplets. Is it theoretically possible to spread it if you share a pair of chopsticks, for instance? We think it is probably theoretically possible, but it is certainly not a major driver of the outbreak. The money is on people with symptoms spreading the disease before they are diagnosed and isolated.  It is more the other way around - the parents have infected the child and the child is asymptomatic, but you can find (the virus) in their throat.  If you are asymptomatic, you are much less likely to spread it because you are not coughing, you are not making the droplets.  Is it theoretically possible to spread it if you share a pair of chopsticks, for instance?  We think it is probably theoretically possible, but it is certainly not a major driver of the outbreak.  The money is on people with symptoms spreading the disease before they are diagnosed and isolated.  So, if that period is a week, they are going to spread it a lot. If it is two days, they will not spread it so much.  If it is two days where they stayed home because they were not feeling well, then they will spread the disease to even fewer people, or to no one.  We know that younger people are unlikely to get serious illness, but they can be an important part of transmission and every young person in Singapore has parents and grandparents who are older.  Everyone needs to pull together to do their part, to help save lives.","89":"SINGAPORE - All short-term visitors will no longer be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore from 11.59pm on Monday (March 23) in view of the heightened risks of importing coronavirus cases into the country.  Work pass holders and their dependants will be allowed to return to Singapore only if they work in sectors that provide essential services such as healthcare and transport.  This will also kick in at 11.59pm on Monday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a statement on Sunday.  The measures were announced a day after two patients - a 75-year-old Singaporean woman and a 64-year-old Indonesian man - died from Covid-19 due to complications. They were the first deaths the Republic has seen in the Covid-19 outbreak.  National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said at a briefing on Sunday morning that the measures to +significantly tighten+ Singapore+s borders are taken in the light of the rapidly escalating virus outbreak around the world.  Previously, except for a handful of countries, short-term visitors from elsewhere were allowed to come into Singapore but were issued a 14-day stay-home notice (SHN) upon arrival.  This meant, however, that resources were being expended to serve and enforce SHNs on them, and if they fell ill, to provide them with medical treatment. On Saturday, there were still 533 short-term visitors arriving in Singapore.  To date, there are more than 260,000 Covid-19 cases across 185 countries, and around 11,200 deaths.  The MOH said that in Singapore, almost 80 per cent of new Covid-19 cases over the past three days were imported, most of them Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning home from abroad.  These imported cases had travel histories to 22 different countries.  There were 432 cases of coronavirus patients in Singapore as of Saturday evening. A total of 140 cases have fully recovered. Of the 290 patients still in hospital, most are stable or improving, but 14 are in critical care.  On the limited entry for work pass holders and their dependants, the Manpower Ministry will allow this only for those in essential services.  On what constitutes essential services, Mr Wong said the Ministry of Manpower will continue to approve applications for the workers to come back according to existing rules, with inputs from relevant government agencies when needed.  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore residents who travel overseas may face consequences as Govt ramps up border controls  He added that foreign domestic helpers could also be considered as offering essential services, especially in cases where they are needed to help look after children or the elderly.  As previously announced, all Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders returning will continue to be issued a 14-day SHN.  In addition, Malaysians with Singapore work permits can continue to work in the Republic during this period, with accommodation arrangements.  Transport of goods between both countries will also be facilitated, the Singapore-Malaysia Special Working Committee has agreed.  Diplomats accredited and based in Singapore can continue to come in. They will also be subjected to the 14-day isolation.  On Sunday, Mr Wong said that these were very significant moves especially for a small open economy like Singapore which has always been connected to the world.  +But this is an unprecedented crisis,+ he said.  He noted that while very few short-term visitors have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, they can take up enforcement and medical resources.  +During this time, we have to focus our resources on returning Singaporeans,+ he said.  On how long these measure will remain in place, he said: +I can+t say at this stage. No one will know how long this current wave of imported cases we are experiencing will last for.+  He added: +It depends on how long the outbreak is going to continue in Europe and America, which are now the new epicentres for the virus outbreak. It (also) depends on how long more we will see returning Singaporeans coming back, so we will monitor on a day by day basis.+  Mr Wong also warned that the Government is considering measures against those who choose to travel overseas despite the border control measures.  +I don+t think we can allow this to continue. We are discussing what additional measures may be needed,+ he said, adding that work pass holders who leave Singapore at this time may face the consequence of not being allowed entry later.  In recent days, most of the new patients in Singapore have been imported cases, that is, returning residents and long-term pass holders with travel history to Europe, North America, South-east Asia and other parts of Asia.  Besides strict border controls, rigorous contact tracing, quarantine and home isolation, the Government has implemented safe distancing measures such as smaller crowd sizes and keeping safe spaces around individuals, especially vulnerable segments of the population like the elderly.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  For example, all events and gatherings with 250 or more participants are to be suspended until June 30, while the suspension of all social activities for seniors by government agencies will be extended for another two weeks until April 7.

He said this will not only help people in the long-term, but it will also help the fight Covid-19 if they get it.  In his opening remarks at the briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, he included the following health tips:  First, eat a health and nutritious diet, which helps your immune system to function properly.  Second, limit your alcohol consumption, and avoid sugary drinks.  Third, do not smoke, he said, as smoking damages your lungs and can increase your risk of developing severe disease if you become infected with Covid-19.  Fourth, exercise. WHO recommends 30 minutes of physical activity a day for adults, and one hour a day for children.  If allowed, go outside for a walk or a run, while keeping a safe distance from others.

Get your information from reliable sources once or twice a day.+  In the same set of remarks, Dr Tedros said: +One of the things we are learning is that although older people are the hardest hit, younger people are not spared.  +Data from many countries clearly show that people under 50 make up a significant proportion of patients requiring hospitalisation.+  At the start of last week, he had warned that although the evidence they have suggests that those over 60 are at highest risk, young people, including children, have died.","96":"SINGAPORE - The 75 year-old Singaporean woman who became the first patient to die of Covid-19 was linked to the cluster at The Life Church and Missions Singapore.  Known as Case 90, she had no recent travel history to China, a Health Ministry statement on Feb 24 had said.  She had reported the onset of symptoms on Feb 9 and sought treatment at a general practitioner+s clinic that day, as well as on Feb 17 and Feb 23.  She was taken in an ambulance to the emergency department of Tan Tock Seng Hospital on Feb 23 and immediately isolated.  Subsequent test results confirmed Covid-19 infection that afternoon. She was warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases and died at 7.52am on Saturday (March 21).  A statement said she had a history of chronic heart disease and hypertension.  In a statement by her church, it said it had received the news of her death.  \u201cAs this is one of the first Covid-19 deaths in Singapore, we are not sure what can or cannot be done with regard to the funeral arrangements,\u201d her church said.  \u201cHer family would make the final decision on the funeral details, as besides our church, her family member attending another church may also seek the assistance of their own church to plan the funeral.\u201d  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Prior to being admitted to hospital, she had kept mostly to her home in Bishan Street 12, a ministry statement had said earlier.

The Ministry of Health had announced measures to reduce the risk of local transmission of the coronavirus, including requiring public venues like eateries, shops and cinemas to keep patrons at least 1m apart.  Though the measures were to be rolled out progressively from Saturday, preparations had already begun at several businesses.  Casual restaurant chain Collin+s has already moved out around 10 per cent of its tables in its Nex shopping mall outlet to ensure adequate spacing between groups of diners.  Mr Jonathan Lim, 48, chief development officer at SF Group, Collin+s parent company, said: +It+s a bit of a sacrifice and dine-in business has been impacted slightly. But we try to cope by having more offers to draw customers to dine during off-peak hours.+  Chinese restaurant Soup Restaurant managing director Wong Wei Teck, 64, similarly said it started implementing the 1m safety distance and collecting diners+ details for contact tracing at two of its 15 outlets. It intends to implement the measures at all outlets by the end of next week.  +We+re a family restaurant and we frequently get big groups. It can be little bit troublesome for customers but it+s safety first,+ said Mr Wong.  Meanwhile, Koi operations project manager Lim Zhi Liang, 34, said that at outlets with self-order touchscreen kiosks, staff will space them at least 1m apart and disinfect the touchscreens every 15 to 30 minutes. Floor markers will be rolled out across all 57 outlets over the next few days.  Over at Zouk in Clarke Quay, the nightspot is limiting the capacity in each of its four venues - Zouk main room, Capital, Phuture and Redtail - to 250 people each, including staff. Guest information will also be collected for contact tracing.  Mr Seah Kian Peng, group chief executive of FairPrice Group, said that 1m floor markers at the checkout counters and storewide announcements every 30 minutes to remind customers to space themselves would be progressively implemented at all 148 FairPrice outlets. He said, however, that there are no plans at the moment to limit the number of shoppers in stores.  NEA and town councils are also in the process of marking out seats at hawker centres to guide patrons on how to practise safe distancing.  To help businesses comply with the new requirements, Enterprise Singapore, the National Environment Agency, the Singapore Food Agency and the Singapore Tourism Board issued two joint advisories on Friday with steps the firms can take.  For instance, it said retail shops may use floor markers, along with clear signage, to indicate queuing positions for fitting rooms and at cashiers.  Shops may also limit the number of people within the store and let shoppers in progressively though supermarkets are advised not to create queues outside their stores.  Food and beverage establishments were advised to reduce queues outside their outlets by taking down diners+ details and calling them when seats are available. If not possible, the 1m floor markers, with clear signage, should be used to manage the crowd.

Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Chee Hong Tat, who on Friday visited some businesses in Nex mall in Serangoon that were putting safe-distancing precautions in place, said the effectiveness of the measures requires the cooperation of everyone.  +The (floor) markers may be there but the public must also get used to making some of these adjustments,+ said Mr Chee.

It was helter-skelter after Malaysia announced a two-week national lockdown on Monday night. The disorder was not just over there but also in Singapore because of the close ties between the two countries.  Students and workers scrambled across the Causeway to beat the lockdown deadline as employers here sought lodgings for their workers.  Like China and Italy, Malaysia has taken drastic action to counter a surge in coronavirus cases, mostly linked to a mass religious event in late February.  When asked if Singapore would consider such a move, which is also in place in France and being considered in London, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong told a press conference on Tuesday that while he could not rule it out, it was not on the cards.  Observers and public health experts say the chaos that ensued after Malaysia+s lockdown showed why such a measure would be warranted only if the outbreak gets out of hand and the benefits outweigh the costs.  Dr Gillian Koh, deputy director for research at the Institute of Policy Studies, told The New Paper: +Singapore+s survival and sustainability depends on borders being open and receiving goods as well as people.  +So the cost of locking down Singapore is very high, both for the economy and for sustaining daily life itself.+  But a recent spike in the number of infections has led to online ire and frustration over people here going on holidays despite advisories to defer non-essential travel.  A record 47 new cases were reported on Wednesday, of which 30 were Singapore residents returning from abroad.  Yesterday, for the first time in five days, the number of new cases dropped, as 32 infections were confirmed, of which 24 were imported, all involving returning Singapore residents.  Arguing why a lockdown was highly unlikely, Dr Koh said: +Even with returning Singaporeans, we have very stringent protocols and all of us do expect them to abide by them... to ensure that we keep the extreme scenario of a lockdown as far away as possible.+  National University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser said it was understandable that Singaporeans felt negatively towards people they deemed socially irresponsible.  Singapore Management University law don Eugene Tan agreed but felt these sentiments would weaken after the outbreak.  Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, infectious diseases programme leader at Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at NUS, said a lockdown is a +nuclear option+ reserved for when community transmission has to be brought under control quickly.  While this seems to have worked for China, which yesterday saw zero new infections in Hubei province for the first time since the virus emerged there, Prof Hsu said lockdowns cannot be done indefinitely.  With the virus spreading in so many countries, it could also still be re-imported.  Whether an outbreak is severe enough to warrant such an extreme measure depends on how much each society can tolerate its costs, said Prof Hsu.  +Sometimes that price is far higher than what the virus can do,+ he added.  TESTING CAPACITY  Making a comparison with South Korea+s approach, which involved expanding its testing capacity rapidly and implementing strict social distancing, Prof Hsu said each country had to find the right balance and use its strengths where possible to control the outbreak.  +We are fortunate that community transmission is low at present, and there is more leeway in terms of what we can do,+ he added.  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore General Hospital to convert part of carpark into fever screening area  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam said it is thanks to the hard work put in earlier during the outbreak that a lockdown is not needed here.  Prof Hsu said what Singapore is doing now is to try to prevent the healthcare system from being overwhelmed at its current capacity, or what is known as flattening the curve.  But at the same time, he said Singapore can also prepare for a possible surge and try to expand healthcare capacity.  He suggested training people to take over some of the work done by nurses so they can be freed up for other tasks.  +For the regular patients... they can just be isolated in a facility where they can+t transmit the virus but can be monitored and taken care of in a way that doesn+t require the heavy resources of a hospital bed or an isolation room,+ Prof Hsu said.  Dr Leong was optimistic that Singapore could maintain its efforts in fighting the virus over the next three to six months but warned against complacency.  Reminding the public to stay home if unwell and urging them to defer travel plans, he said: +We have all the necessary ingredients to overcome this outbreak. But all this is hanging precariously. If we are not careful, it can be lost at the drop of a hat.+  LISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST","109":"SINGAPORE - Malaysians with Singapore work permits can continue to work in Singapore with health screening and accommodation arrangements made for them, while food and products will continue to be transported across the border smoothly.

The two Senior Ministers discussed the arrangements to ensure the health of the citizens on both sides of the border, while minimising disruptions to companies, workers and citizens.  The MFA said that Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri assured Mr Teo that Malaysia will facilitate the smooth transport of food, while both sides will ensure the transport of commercial goods across the land checkpoint.  At a separate news conference is Malaysia, the Malaysian minister said: \u201cI understand there were discussions. And both sides have agreed that all workers will continue to work there.

Employers who place their staff on this voluntary LOA will be able to claim daily support under a programme by the MOM aimed at alleviating the companies+ financial burden during the Covid-19 outbreak.  This initiative follows recent, stricter measures imposed by schools to curb the spread of the coronavirus, after more infections and a surge in imported cases were recorded in Singapore.  All students and staff who returned from overseas between last Saturday (March 14) and this Friday will be put on a mandatory 14-day leave of absence from the date of return.  From 11.59pm on Friday, all arriving travellers, including Singaporeans, will face even more stringent measures and will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice.  This means they will not be able to leave their homes for 14 days.  In encouraging companies to voluntarily impose the LOA on Friday, the MOM said: +The Government recognises that many parents have been affected by this national measure due to the need to provide care for their children during this period.  +At the same time, it is a useful precautionary measure for people who have travelled recently to stay away from the workplace to prevent further transmission.+  The MOM said companies should adopt flexible work arrangements to allow these employees to work from home during that whole 14-day period.  It noted that some companies had already voluntarily asked employees to stay home after returning from trips overseas between last Saturday and Friday.  Such companies should continue with existing flexible work and leave arrangements, including asking their employees to use their annual leave to cover the company imposed LOA, said the MOM.  However, for those companies that have not put such measures in place, +employers are encouraged to provide additional paid leave to the employees, if work from home is not feasible+, considering that the LOA option was not known before their employees travelled.  To help these companies, the MOM will allow them to apply for the $100 daily support under the LOA support programme, which covers only employees who are Singaporeans, permanent residents or work pass holders.  Companies can also claim a levy waiver for their affected work pass holders.  Those who are self-employed and who have to put themselves on LOA will similarly be allowed to claim this daily support.  Eligible employers will be able to apply for daily support for each affected employee after their LOA is completed.  However, employers, self-employed Singaporeans and permanent residents will not be able to claim under the support programme if they worked remotely during the LOA period or if the affected employee had to use his or her own annual leave, childcare leave or any other kind of leave to cover the LOA.  Additionally, those who have been placed on stay-home notice upon returning to Singapore and whose travel was not between March 14 to 20 are not eligible for daily support under this programme.  Said the MOM: +As the Covid-19 situation continues to evolve, there may be additional requirements imposed on work pass holders from time to time.+  It urged employers and employees to check the MOM website for the latest advisories.

The Anglican Diocese of Singapore said on Thursday (March 19) that this was with immediate effect to +create a two-week break in church gatherings+.  +The Diocesan leadership has closely monitored the escalating Covid-19 situation and makes this contribution towards the concerted national effort to +flatten the coronavirus curve+,+ it said, referring to the graph that shows a lower number of infected cases over time with proper containment measures.  There are currently 27 parishes of varying sizes in the Anglican Diocese of Singapore, with an average weekly attendance of about 21,000.  The churches plan to be open before the weekend of April 4 and 5, the start of Holy Week, which is the week leading up to Easter Sunday on April 12.  In the meantime, online weekend services will be conducted, and pastoral care will given to the elderly and the vulnerable.  The announcement comes after St Andrew+s Cathedral, the oldest Anglican site of worship in Singapore, was closed after one of its members was infected with the coronavirus.  On Wednesday, a notice was put up informing members that the church, located next to City Hall, would be closed from 11.59pm on Wednesday to 11.59pm on April 3 for the affected premises to be professionally disinfected.

Among them, 33 were imported and 30 involved Singapore residents returning from abroad. This brought the total number of cases here to 313.  In light of these recent developments, it is vital that people mind their health, and take the necessary precautions should they feel unwell.  Q: What are the symptoms for Covid-19?  The two most common symptoms for Covid-19 are fever (of 37.8 deg C and above) and cough.  Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam said that those who are experiencing either of the two symptoms, or both, should consult a doctor.  He also added that those who feel generally unwell should also see a doctor, noting that practically all the identified Covid-19 cases had the sensation of being unwell at some point.  Q: What about mild, flu-like symptoms which are not fever and cough? Should I visit the doctor as well?  Other mild, flu-like symptoms such as sore throat, stuffy nose and runny nose should be monitored closely for at least five days, said Dr Leong, as sore throat and stuffy nose were not symptoms present in 90 per cent of the confirmed Covid-19 cases.  However, people should look out for any prolonged or worsening symptoms, as well as new, developing symptoms, he noted, and see a doctor if these occur.  In the meantime, individuals should practise self-quarantine measures at home and avoid going out, as there is a chance they could be incubating the virus.  Q: Can I self-medicate at home if I+m facing any of the above symptoms?  You may self-medicate if you are facing mild symptoms. However, you should visit a doctor if the symptoms are prolonged or worsening.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  If you are having a cough or fever, which are common Covid-19 symptoms, you should definitely visit a doctor.  On whether people suffering from Covid-19 symptoms should avoid taking ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug meant for fever and pain, Dr Leong said that it has not yet been clinically proven that the drug predisposes the body to more infections.  But he suggests they choose alternatives such as paracetamol, synflex or voltaren as a precautionary measure.  Q: Should I visit the doctor if I+m experiencing breathlessness?  Yes, although breathlessness does not usually develop until the later stages of Covid-19. By then, individuals would have experienced other accompanying symptoms as well, noted Dr Leong.  Dr Piotr Chlebicki, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Alvernia Hospital, also shared the same advice, adding that breathlessness is cause for medical attention, as the individual could be facing other complications like heart disease or asthma.  Q: What if I am asymptomatic so far, but I don+t feel very well in general, should I still see the doctor?  Yes, as long as you are feeling unwell, or sense that something is out of the ordinary, it would be a good idea to visit the doctor.  Dr Chlebicki also suggested that it would be good practice to call in to clinics before going, as this could help reduce overcrowding.  In addition, you should also refrain from doctor-hopping, said MOH in an advisory on March 11, as going back to the same doctor could ensure follow-up, and that you+re sent for Covid-19 testing if necessary.","121":"SINGAPORE - New developments for the Covid-19 situation have been coming thick and fast over the past few days, with Malaysia deciding to impose a lockdown and fresh travel restrictions being put in place by Singapore.

As of Wednesday, Singapore has seen 558 cases, of which two patients have died. Of the total, 155 have recovered.  The crux of Singapore+s strategy is to slow down the infection rate and maintain it at as low a level for as long as possible, Mr Gan said.  This will help the country to better conduct epidemiological investigations, contact tracing and quarantining of close contacts, to prevent further spread and to preserve healthcare capacity to care for the more severe cases.  These were the key points in his ministerial statement.  3 waves of cases  Singapore has seen three waves of cases so far.  Late-January to February: Imported cases from China. The virus originated in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province. These early patients were mostly tourists from Wuhan to Singapore.  February to March: Some of these imported cases led to local clusters, such as one at a health products store frequented by Chinese tourists, and another cluster comprising two churches. Two Chinese visitors had visited one of the churches, leading to Singaporeans being infected.  Mid-March to present: Second wave of imported cases. This has seen numbers doubling in a week from 266 to 558 as of Tuesday, and almost 80 per cent of these were imported. The patients are not from China, even though about 1,000 Singapore permanent residents and long-term pass holders have returned from China in the past week.  Instead, the new cases are Singaporeans and residents returning from three key countries: Britain, the United States and Indonesia.  The big worry now: +Over the coming weeks, the number of cases will continue to rise, as some of our around 200,000 overseas Singaporeans return home from all over the world,+ said Mr Gan.  Singapore+s 3-pronged strategy to fight Covid-19  1. Reduce importation of cases  Border controls have been imposed since January to stem the inflow of travellers to the country.  First, recent visitors to Hubei were barred entry. Now, all short-term visitors from anywhere in the world are barred entry and transit.  Only Singaporeans, PRs and long-term work pass holders can return from abroad.  Residents are also urged not to travel and will face penalties - such as unsubsidised Covid-19 care - should they do.  2. Detect and isolate cases early  Since news of the virus emerged, border checks have been strengthened to detect and isolate cases before they come into contact with the rest of Singapore.  For example, temperature screening, health checks and swabbing have been progressively implemented at all checkpoints.  Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far  Related Story Interactive: How coronavirus is spreading across the world  Suspected cases are conveyed directly to hospitals, and symptomatic travellers and some selected travellers are swabbed as a precautionary measure.  Beyond checkpoints, there is a surveillance system in place at hospitals, polyclinics and the more than 900 clinics under the Public Health Preparedness scheme.  These clinics offer attractive subsidised rates for patients with respiratory illnesses to seek treatment and be spotted early if they have Covid-19.  There have been more than 267,000 subsidised attendances at these clinics so far, on top of patients checked at polyclinics, said Mr Gan.  To date, Singapore has done around 39,000 Covid-19 tests. This translates to 6,800 tests per million people in Singapore. It compares with about 6,500 in South Korea and 1,000 in Taiwan.  Said Mr Gan: +These tests are important in helping us to detect as many cases as possible and as early as possible.+  Contact tracing is also a crucial weapon.  The moment a case is confirmed, contact tracing is activated to identify close contacts and to quarantine them as soon as possible, so as to reduce further spread of the disease.  Singapore has ramped up contact tracing efforts, from three teams when the process started to 20 teams. Officers are from the Health Ministry, Singapore Police Force and, now, also agencies like the Singapore Armed Forces.  The teams can trace up to 4,000 contacts each day, and will continue to scale up as needed. Technology is also being used, such as the TraceTogether app launched by the Health Ministry and GovTech last week.  3. Emphasis on social responsibility and good personal hygiene  The Government has stressed how individuals must play their part to reduce the risk of transmission. They can do this through good personal hygiene, social responsibility, and safe distancing.  Related Story Keeping clean the first line of defence against coronavirus: Expert panel  It has urged people to abide by quarantine orders and stay-home notices.  +If you violate them, there will be penalties, and the greatest penalty is that you may infect others close to you,+ the minister said.  Messages on things like the need to wash your hands and to see a doctor immediately have been widely circulated.  The Government has also extended help to employers whose employees have to serve out quarantine and stay-home notices.  The Health Ministry has paid particular attention to seniors, urging them to stay safe and to avoid activities in large groups.  Research efforts  Scientists in Singapore have been developing research and knowledge on Covid-19 and sharing these with other countries, said Mr Gan.  In the area of treatment, a therapeutic work group comprising members from various hospitals across different disciplines and the Health Sciences Authority has been set up.  It is working on guidelines for repurposed drugs with antiviral activity - such as Lopinavir-ritonavir, Interferon Beta-1B and hydroxychloroquine - to treat infected patients in Singapore.  The National Centre for Infectious Disease and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, together with the Singapore Blood Blank, have started to collect convalescent blood plasma from recovered patients for treatment for other patients.  Related Story How Singapore developed a test for Covid-19 antibodies that linked three infection clusters  Related Story Coronavirus: Singapore labs join global race to learn about virus  Doctors have also been taking part in international clinical trials, with collaborators such as the United States National Institutes of Health.  On vaccines, scientists around the world have successfully isolated and cultured the virus, which will help develop a vaccine, said Mr Gan.  Global work is also being done to identify vaccine candidates and conduct testing, such as how Moderna Inc has started human trials.  Singapore+s Duke-NUS Medical School is working with Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and international partners to develop a clinical trial for a vaccine. There are plans to start testing this year.  Mr Gan said that with all these ongoing efforts, WHO estimates that the earliest a vaccine will be ready would likely be sometime next year.  +We do not know how long the pandemic will last, but we have to plan on the basis that Covid-19 will be with us for a long while, maybe till the end of the year or longer, and ensure that we have the resources and capabilities to see us through.+  Managing healthcare capacity  The Government has said it will ensure sufficient capacity to meet not just the needs of Covid-19 patients but also that of other patients.  Investments had already been made to manage infectious outbreaks in Singapore, with the 330-bed National Centre for Infections Diseases (NCID) built for just this purpose, and with spare capacity, said Mr Gan.  Related Story Coronavirus: 49 patients moved to private hospitals to free up capacity at public facilities  The NCID can be further increased to over 500 beds if needed, he added.  To fight the coronavirus, public hospitals had earlier reviewed their patients and deferred non-urgent and elective procedures, while also ensuring these patients get enough supportive care.  The ministry is also collaborating with private hospitals for some non-Covid-19 patients to be cared for there instead.  Also, because about 80 per cent of Covid-19 cases have been found to be mild to moderate, the MOH is tapping private hospitals and setting up community care facilities for such patients. Patients here will continue to be quarantined and closely monitored so there is no community risk. Only when they have fully recovered and tested negative for the virus twice over 24 hours will they be discharged.  These steps will allow critical hospital resources to be focused on the seriously ill and minimise deaths.  Mr Gan also noted how healthcare workers - +the most important resource+ - are taking on a very heavy load, and thanked them, and said measures have been put in place to reduce burnout. +Most importantly, every case we can avoid will help to lighten their load,+ he said.  +No sharp peak or long tail+  Just as it+s important to ensure sufficient healthcare capacity, it is equally important to prevent new local clusters in the first place, he stressed.  Related Story Coronavirus: How flattening the epidemic curve will buy time and keep outbreak in check  Related Story Steps countries are taking to buy time to help fight the virus  Related Story Coronavirus: How South Korea flattened the curve  This way, Singapore can try to avoid an exponential growth in the number of infections, which could quickly overwhelm the healthcare system, as seen in Hubei and Italy, and increasingly in many other countries.  Singapore+s strategy is to slow down the infection rate and maintain it at as low a level for as long as possible, Mr Gan told Parliament.  A lower infection rate will help the country to better conduct epidemiological investigations, contact tracing and quarantining of close contacts, to prevent further spread in the community, he said.  It also preserves healthcare capacity to care for the more severe cases.  He noted that if nothing is done, the number of cases will shoot up, as seen in some countries.  In such a scenario, the only hope is that most of the population gets infected and becomes immune, and the rate of infection starts to slow down as more become immune, or a vaccine or a cure is found.  +This scenario may seem attractive - you get over with it very quickly - but there are unfortunately two major risks,+ Mr Gan said.  First, an uncontrolled spike in the number of cases in a short period of time will overwhelm the healthcare system, easily resulting in high mortality rates, +and there is no turning back once we are on this track+.  The second risk is that it is not certain yet that this immunity will be effective or sustained.  One alternative is to introduce stringent safe distancing and other measures to slow down the infection rate.  +The number will still grow, but if we do it right, we will end up with a lower peak,+ he said.  This is commonly known as flattening the curve.  +But by flattening the curve, we may actually stretch out the pandemic, meaning it will take longer for the pandemic to be over,+ he said.  +For Singapore, we are still at the start of the curve today, and we have a chance, to do neither,+ he said.  +We hope that if we do it right, we can significantly slow down the growth as much as we can, until the pandemic is over, without either a sharp peak or long tail,+ he said.  +This may sound impossible, because these are the two curves that are established by academics. But as impossible as it may sound, we have to try our best to do so.+  LISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST","143":"Infectious diseases experts here are urging people to stay home unless they are +100 per cent+ well, following news that some of the staff in the coronavirus cluster at PCF Sparkletots in Fengshan were at work while sick.  Dr Leong Hoe Nam, who practises at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, told The Straits Times: +If you look at the numbers, we+re hitting around 70 cases a day. If we do this consecutively for five days, we+d need a new National Centre for Infectious Diseases to hold the patients.  +If this goes on, our whole healthcare system will be overloaded.  +So everyone must play their part, no ifs or buts. If you+re even a little bit unwell, please don+t go out, stay at home. It+s high stakes now.+  Professor Paul Tambyah, from the National University of Singapore+s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, agreed.  +Right now when there is a worldwide coronavirus pandemic, it is best to stay home if one does not feel 100 per cent well,+ he said.  As of yesterday, there were 25 cases of infection in the PCF Fengshan cluster.  The pre-school principal was well when she went to work on March 17 but developed symptoms that afternoon. On that day, she had a meeting with her staff, and attended a course with other pre-school staff in the evening.  Most of the staff from the centre who tested positive for the virus began developing symptoms from March 20.  Nine family members of the principal also tested positive.  Dr Leong said that on average, an individual spreads the virus to only two to three people.  Related Story Coronavirus: ECDA orders Fengshan PCF Sparkletots centre to close for 2 weeks after teacher tests positive  Related Story All PCF centres to close for 4 days after coronavirus cluster reported at Fengshan Sparkletots pre-school  Some, however, will pass the infection to at least five to 10 others.  Citing a recent study on the spread of the coronavirus in Singapore, Prof Tambyah highlighted that 88 per cent of individuals did not transmit the infection to anyone, even when they were not in quarantine.  However, three or four patients would later become the source for some major clusters.  He said: +The vast majority of people do not spread (the virus responsible for Covid-19) to anyone.  +On the other hand, a few individuals become the index patients for large numbers of secondary and tertiary cases.+  Both Prof Tambyah and Dr Leong emphasised that it is better to refer to a +super-spreading event+, rather than a +super spreader+.  The term +super spreader+ pins a lot of responsibility and blame on a single individual, while in reality there may be other factors at play.  Dr Leong added: +We shouldn+t pin and judge people with retrospective vision. If anyone knew what would happen after a particular action was taken, if they knew it would lead to a spread, they wouldn+t have taken it.+  Related Story How a party became a +super-spreader+  There are several lessons to be learnt from the PCF cluster. Noting that the principal developed symptoms only in the afternoon, Dr Leong said workplaces should take temperatures thrice a day.  On the meeting that the principal attended, he added: +It+s a good reminder that we ought not to meet if possible. If you have to meet, an open-air environment is preferred to an air-conditioned one.+  Those in a meeting room should maintain a 1m to 2m distance from one another, and should declare if they are feeling unwell before joining the meeting. They should also not share food or drinks.","157":"SINGAPORE - Biologist Marcus Chua turned 36 on Thursday (March 26) but the birthday was a bittersweet occasion despite his swanky surroundings in a plush hotel in the Marina Bay area with sweeping views of Singapore+s famous city skyline.  It might all look five-star at first glance but the new reality for the many people like Mr Chua complying with 14-day stay-home notices is far from fancy.  Room service at the Swissotel the Stamford for some might be a fancy dinner on a silver tray but he makes do with a meal hung on his door in a disposable plastic box. Exercise? Walk around the room.  Mr Chua+s +birthday staycay+ began when he flew back from the United States on Thursday night (March 26), prepared to serve the stay-home period in a hotel instead of in his own home.  +Even though it was a pity that I could not see my family after arriving in Singapore, it+s actually my preferred option to stay elsewhere so there is less chance of me transmitting the virus to others if I had been infected,+ said Mr Chua, a PhD student at George Mason University in Washington DC.  The Ministry of Health ruled on Tuesday (March 24) that all Singaporeans returning from Britain and the US from 11.59pm on Wednesday will have to serve their 14-day stay-home notices in dedicated facilities instead of their own homes.  This was because those coming in from both these countries account for the largest share of imported cases by far. About 1,200 people a day have been returning from these two countries.  Returnees will have their own room and bathroom and all meals provided so that they avoid physical contact with other individuals, the MOH said.

Mr Chua, a mammal scientist at the National University of Singapore+s (NUS) Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, told The Straits Times that he had initially considered staying put in the US to finish the semester but the escalating crisis there and repeated reminders from NUS and the Singapore Embassy to come home prompted him to change his mind.

Thankfully, the Alaska Airlines flight departed on time and Mr Chua found himself in San Francisco with about a day to spare.  He said: +There was a huge sense of comfort when I boarded the Singapore Airlines flight. Not only did it remind me of home, it was also comforting to see cabin crew taking precautions by donning surgical masks.+  And then there was a chime.    But no one at the door except a pack of dinner selected during check in.    I could only yell a quick thank you as the deliverer made a hasty retreat down the hallway.

Passengers were also placed at least a seat apart from one another.  When they arrived at Changi Airport, passengers were served stay-home notices by Immigration and Checkpoints Authority officers and bussed to the hotel in groups of 15 in 40-seater coaches.

That is because the elderly are vulnerable to virus infections, including Covid-19, she said.  Those with symptoms of acute respiratory illness who are prescribed five days+s medical leave at home should avoid contact with all family members of any age, even at mealtimes, said Professor Leo.  She added that if it is absolutely necessary to interact with others at home, those on medical leave should put on a surgical mask.  Separately, they should also take care of their personal hygiene, washing their hands frequently with water and soap or using hand sanitiser.  They should keep their surroundings clean, and preferably use a dedicated toilet which others in the house do not use.  If this is not possible, the toilet they use must be kept clean.  Prof Leo said: +This is necessary as we learn more about Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19.+  The virus can be spread through both direct and indirect droplet transmission, she added.  This could take place through close face-to-face contact within 1m to 2m of an infected person, or through interaction with a contaminated environment or contaminated objects.  Prof Leo said: +NCID would like to stress that anyone who has acute respiratory illness, regardless of severity, should put on a surgical mask and seek early medical consultation.+  Common symptoms of acute respiratory illness include fever, cough, sore throat and runny nose.  +If the doctor provides five days+ rest at home, please adhere closely to that - rest at home and do not leave the house,+added Prof Leo.  Her comments come a day after the Ministry of Health announced updates to the Infectious Diseases Act, stating that those with acute respiratory symptoms who are given a five-day medical certificate by a doctor must not leave home from the day the MC is given, except to seek medical attention.  Those who fail to comply can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or face both penalties upon conviction.
