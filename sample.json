A new date for the convention will be announced soon, said organisers. Sneaker Con is the world's premier event for sneaker enthusiasts to buy, sell and trade their shoe collections. The Singapore edition, which is the inaugural South-east Asian sneaker convention, is presented by JD Sports and supported by the Singapore Tourism Board. The postponement of Sneaker Con comes after news of the cancellations of major events in Singapore, including the well-loved Geylang Serai Ramadan Bazaar organised by the People's Association and the annual travel fair held by the National Association of Travel Agents Singapore (Natas).","1":"SINGAPORE - Singapore has confirmed 40 new Covid-19 cases, including 30 that are imported, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday (March 20). This brings the total number of infected patients here to 385. Of these, almost half - 190 - are imported cases. In a statement, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) said it supported the new measures. Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so farSeven more cases have been discharged from hospital, bringing the total number of patients who have fully recovered to 131.","2":"SINGAPORE - Restaurant owners closed tables, while retailers spaced out customers queueing up as they geared up on Friday (March 20) for new safe distancing requirements. The Ministry of Health had announced measures to reduce the risk of local transmission of the coronavirus, including requiring public venues like eateries, shops and cinemas to keep patrons at least 1m apart. For instance, it said retail shops may use floor markers, along with clear signage, to indicate queuing positions for fitting rooms and at cashiers. If not possible, the 1m floor markers, with clear signage, should be used to manage the crowd. 'The (floor) markers may be there but the public must also get used to making some of these adjustments,' said Mr Chee.","3":"SINGAPORE - Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will not address the nation on Friday night (March 20), contrary to messages circulating online that he will do so in a live telecast at 8pm. A government spokesman at a multi-ministry task force briefing on Friday also said no lockdown is expected in the near future. There has been an increase in false reports posted and reposted online since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in recent months, with the Government having to make use of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act to clamp down on rumours several times. In January, two Facebook accounts were told to make corrections to posts claiming that Woodlands MRT station was closed for disinfection because of a suspected Covid-19 case. SPH Magazines was also asked in January to correct an online post in the HardwareZone forum that falsely claimed a man in Singapore had died from the virus infection, while The States Times Review Facebook page in the same month was instructed to correct a post that claimed Singapore had run out of face masks.","4":"SINGAPORE - A contact-tracing smartphone app has been launched to allow the local authorities to quickly track people who have been exposed to confirmed coronavirus cases. 'This is especially useful in cases where the infected persons do not know everyone whom they had been in close proximity with for an extended duration,' said its developers. 'When requested by MOH, users can send their TraceTogether logs to facilitate the contact tracing process. Up to that point, the authorities, including MOH and GovTech, have no knowledge of the user's TraceTogether data,' said SNDGO. Scan the QR code to download the TraceTogether app.","5":"SINGAPORE - The suspension of all social activities organised by government agencies for seniors will be extended for another two weeks until April 7. This is to safeguard seniors' well-being amid the Covid-19 outbreak, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong on Friday (March 20). All organisers of other activities that involve physical interactions among seniors should also suspend their plans until April 7. Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so farThe suspension has been in effect since March 11. Seniors are encouraged to remain active during this period through activities that do not require close contact such as by using online platforms, Mr Gan said.","6":"SINGAPORE - Access to a post deemed offensive to Muslims and Christians has been disabled by Facebook, and the police are now investigating the issue, said Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam on Friday (March 20). Describing the post as 'very offensive' to the two religious communities, Mr Shanmugam said in a Facebook post that the authorities asked Facebook to disable access to the post in Singapore. On Wednesday, the Facebook page named NUS Atheist Society had posted an image of the Bible and the Quran, which are holy texts in Christianity and Islam respectively. NUS added that it had asked Facebook to look into the account\u2019s legitimacy on Thursday, as well as last year. Before it was blocked to Singapore users, the offending post was criticised by several people on Facebook in their comments.","7":"Golden Village, Shaw Theatres, Cathay Cineplexes and The Projector told The New Paper they remain open amid the Covid-19 outbreak and have no plans to cease operations for now. Shaw Theatres and Cathay Cineplexes are reviewing their programming and turning to their own titles to bolster their line-up. Golden Village and Shaw Theatres have implemented compulsory seat gaps between patrons to ensure they are at least one metre apart. Shaw Theatres has reduced some sessions so that more time can be allocated between screenings for thorough cleaning of the halls. Meanwhile, StarHub launched its new StarHub HomeHub Plus service which boasts over 90,000 hours of shows on StarHub Entertainment and Netflix.","8":"SINGAPORE - The spokes of the Singapore Flyer have begun turning again after four months of suspension, but the attraction's operating hours will be cut by more than half for the safety of its guests amid the Covid-19 heath situation. Singapore Flyer said that operations resumed on Friday (March 20) after getting approval from the authorities on Thursday. But it has taken some precautionary measures to allow guests to enjoy its flights and facilities \u201cwith a peace of mind\u201d. Its operating hours \u2013 initially from 8.30am to 10.30pm daily \u2013 will be reduced to just six hours, from 3pm to 9pm. It gave the Singapore Flyer the go-ahead to operate again on Thursday.","9":"SINGAPORE - All worship services at Methodist churches here will be suspended for two weeks till April 4. The Methodist Church in Singapore said on Friday (March 20) that it plans to resume services on April 5, which is Palm Sunday and marks the start of Holy Week before Easter Sunday on April 12. The Methodist Church in Singapore has more than 40 churches and around 44,000 members, according to its website. They can instead tune in to live-streaming and podcast services available at www.methodist.org.sg\/livestream or check out the arrangements by individual churches. On Thursday, the Anglican Diocese of Singapore had also suspended all regular worship services and gatherings in Anglican parish churches islandwide till April 3.","10":"SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - Experts believe Covid-19 can be defeated without resorting to such an extreme measure with heavy costs. The disorder was not just over there but also in Singapore because of the close ties between the two countries. Students and workers scrambled across the Causeway to beat the lockdown deadline as employers here sought lodgings for their workers. A record 47 new cases were reported on Wednesday, of which 30 were Singapore residents returning from abroad. Yesterday, for the first time in five days, the number of new cases dropped, as 32 infections were confirmed, of which 24 were imported, all involving returning Singapore residents.","11":"SINGAPORE - Malaysians with Singapore work permits can continue to work in Singapore with health screening and accommodation arrangements made for them, while food and products will continue to be transported across the border smoothly.

The MOM said companies should adopt flexible work arrangements to allow these employees to work from home during that whole 14-day period. Those who are self-employed and who have to put themselves on LOA will similarly be allowed to claim this daily support. Eligible employers will be able to apply for daily support for each affected employee after their LOA is completed.

For PMET vacancies, employers valued candidates' skills, work experience, and attitude over academic qualifications for about half (46 per cent) of the vacancies. The lack of necessary specialised skills was the top challenge faced by employers trying to fill PMET vacancies, said MOM. Some 19 per cent of PMET vacancies were unfilled for at least six months, compared with 41 per cent of non-PMET vacancies.","14":"Q What is a quarantine order?
